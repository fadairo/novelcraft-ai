## Synopsis

# His Excellency — Synopsis

When the novel opens in March 2011, **Peter Rourke** is a cautionary footnote. Two years earlier an activist—Marcus Clayton—was crushed during a protest at one of Peter’s Atlanta construction sites, bankrupting his real-estate empire and turning the fifty-two-year-old developer into a pariah. Enter his estranged son **Eugene**, a data-savvy wunderkind now apprenticed to an unnamed U.S. senator who is quietly engineering a hard-right realignment. Eugene offers resurrection: Peter will front the **Restored South Leadership Council**, a dark-money network that mixes Citizens-United cash with heritage-pageant aesthetics. All Peter must do is read the lines and look like gravitas incarnate.

Peter accepts. Media fixer **Ray Talcott** drills him in cable-ready sound-bites—_Restoration, Not Revolution_—while ex-wife **Felicity Prejean Rourke**, a hurricane-forged televangelist, agrees to play the loyal partner on camera in exchange for shared brand supremacy. The crowds grow; donors toast him as “His Excellency.” Yet two people refuse to forget the body under the Atlanta rebar. One is **Rosa Santiago**, the investigative reporter who covered Clayton’s death; she has digitised every suppressed invoice, every hush-order e-mail, and she is still digging. The other is **Tony McQuade**, a laid-off Louisiana cop whose faith in Peter’s speeches curdles into militia zeal.

The Council’s ascent is vertiginous. By spring 2013 a South-Carolina senate seat opens after a mysterious car wreck, and Eugene floats his father’s name. Peter tastes genuine power—then Rosa leaks a tranche of Atlanta files linking the Rourke dynasty to a 1946 lynching and twenty-first-century zoning fraud. Donors bolt, Ray retreats, and Eugene abstains as the Council votes his father out. Peter is demoted to a windowless “consultant” cubicle, discovering too late that figureheads are cheap—and disposable.

Exile does not spare him the sight of what he has unleashed. From the Ferguson uprising to Donald Trump’s escalator descent, Peter watches echo after echo of his own slogans weaponised without attribution. Felicity flourishes as a law-and-order matriarch; Eugene perfects micro-targeting software that turns hurricane-relief rosters into voter-suppression gold. Online, Tony McQuade stitches Peter’s rhetoric into video manifestos that travel faster than truth. Peter feels pride and horror in equal measure: the movement no longer needs him, yet it still bears his fingerprints.

On Election Night 2016 the Restorationists claim the White House. Peter sits alone in his apartment, the television bleeding red states across the map, his phone silent. The last thing he burns before dawn is Rosa’s final dossier—proof that nothing stays buried forever, even in ash. He has achieved the title, proximity to power, and historic mention he craved, but at the cost of agency, family, and any remaining shard of conscience. He is, finally, the hollow patriarch of a dynasty that perfected his darkest impulses and left him behind.

**His Excellency** marries Southern-Gothic unease to contemporary political thriller, charting the rise of a manufactured elder-statesman and the personal collapse hidden inside public triumph. It is a story of dark money and darker nostalgia, of how fathers become scaffolds for more ruthless sons—and how scaffolds are meant to be kicked away.

## Overview

## Detailed Report

## Opening

First impressions: Excellency is an ambitious, timely political novel that blends family saga, media satire, and the slow rise of a reactionary movement. The core concept—one man’s hunger for relevance turning him into a symbol and then a puppet—has real power. The book locates that personal collapse inside a larger system: think tanks, donors, dark money, and the “restoration” rhetoric that prefigures an authoritarian turn. The material feels researched and lived-in. The settings convince. The stakes are moral and public.

Overall potential: High. The manuscript already delivers vivid scenes (Peter accepting the fake gavel; Felicity commanding a room with a smile; Rosa with the flash drive; Tony on the edge; the 2013 campaign launch; the 2014 Ferguson scene; the 2021 convoy). The narrative’s mosaic structure—shifting time, voice, and form—creates a broad lens. Its risks are sprawl, density, and tonal over-saturation. Tightening the throughline and modulating the prose will elevate what’s here without sacrificing scope.

Suggestions to focus potential:
- Clarify the book’s spine: Peter vs. Rosa is the clearest engine. Use it to anchor the chronology and selection of set-pieces.
- Decide what the book promises in Act One and fulfill that promise by the end: Is it the cost of Peter’s ascent, or the exposure of the machine, or the fracture of a family? The current draft gestures at all three; choosing a primary vector will sharpen impact.
- Treat the 2021 material as culmination rather than another strand: tie it directly to earlier choices, not as a new thread.

## Voice and Point of View

Strengths:
- Distinct, energetic voices. Peter’s close-third is weary and self-justifying. Rosa’s investigative first-person is precise and purposeful. Tony’s jolting interior monologue captures a mind under economic pressure and media influence. The institutional voice (think tanks, media rooms) rings true.
- Confident use of documentary forms (dossiers, transcripts, FOIA requests, memos) adds texture and authenticity.

Weaknesses:
- The density of metaphor and commentary can overwhelm scene and character. At times the narrator editorializes for the reader, reducing room for inference.
- POV shifts are frequent and sometimes abrupt. The inserted “Chapter 5 Analysis” breaks immersion; it reads like an external critique inside the story world.
- A few voices shade toward caricature (Eugene’s corporate-speak, Felicity’s polished control) when the text could do more with contradiction and surprise.

Actionable suggestions:
- Establish a consistent POV pattern early. For example: odd-numbered chapters in Peter close-third; even-numbered chapters in Rosa first-person; interludes (Tony/Silas/Malcolm) clearly flagged with date/place tags. Keep that pattern for at least the first 25% to build trust.
- Add clear headers to every scene change (city, month/year) to smooth time hops.
- Recast the “Chapter 5 Analysis” as diegetic: a memo Rosa writes to her editor, or an internal campaign brief from Ray. This preserves the information without breaking the fourth wall.
- Once per chapter, remove one paragraph of on-the-nose commentary and replace it with a physical beat or action that implies the same judgment. Trust subtext.

## Characterization

Strengths:
- Peter is complex: self-pitying, needy, sharp enough to see his own compromise but not strong enough to resist it. His tremor, his attention to small humiliations, and his hunger to “matter” are sharply observed.
- Rosa works as the moral center. Her methods (archives, storage units, air-gapped computers) give credibility, and her personal cost is suggested.
- Felicity is a compelling operator, a queenmaker whose charm is a tool. The interplay with Eugene (the architect) shows a family that treats politics as business.
- The bench is deep: Ray Talcott, The Senator, Margaret Chen, Patricia Wilkes, Savannah—all feel plugged into real systems.

Weaknesses:
- Eugene risks flattening into “cold strategist.” We glimpse very little that he fears or loves. The engagement subplot offers an opening to deepen him, but we don’t yet see the private stakes.
- Felicity’s humanity peeks through then snaps shut. One or two private moments of doubt or cost would prevent her from reading as pure performance.
- Marcus Clayton is vital but mostly appears as a memory and newspaper photo. His on-page presence is thin for the weight he carries.
- Tony’s arc is strong on texture but unclear in causality. How exactly do Malcolm’s broadcasts, economic collapse, and Peter’s rhetoric mesh to nudge him toward violence?

Actionable suggestions:
- Give Eugene one scene where his mask slips with someone who can’t help him—an old friend, a sibling, or Savannah. Let him be wrong-footed, even briefly.
- Give Felicity a private beat where the performance fails (e.g., a stumble like the loose thread in Chapter 8, but extended). What did she sacrifice earlier in life? Show one small cost.
- Add one early Marcus scene (pre-accident). A five-page chapter of him leading, or his graduation speech with Rosa in the crowd, will raise the emotional floor later.
- Clarify Tony’s throughline with three clean beats: loss (job/family), first contact (Malcolm’s show or forum), activation (a Peter speech quote landing on a tender bruise). Put them on the page to replace inference with causality.

## Plot and Pacing

Strengths:
- The sequence from grooming to rise to leak to fall is strong. The 2013 health leak is an effective midpoint reversal.
- Set-pieces are well chosen: Heritage donors, the Council’s “gavel,” the Mayflower event, the Cosmos Club meeting. These rooms carry dramatic weight.
- The Rosa threat escalates logically: FOIAs, witnesses, documents.

Weaknesses:
- The timeline jumps often and late-arriving threads (1946 ledger; Heritage Center operations; 2021 convoy) dilute the central chase.
- Some chapters end just before the dramatic beat (e.g., repeated “What about Atlanta?” cutaways), which can frustrate momentum.
- The antagonist is diffuse. Is Peter’s main opposition Rosa, The Senator, Felicity/Eugene, or exposure itself? The answer shifts by section.

Actionable suggestions:
- Choose a throughline: Peter vs. Rosa. Let The Senator and Felicity/Eugene function as forces that pull Peter further from himself, while Rosa pushes toward truth. Build the act breaks around that push/pull.
- Map the book into four parts:
  1) Grooming (2011) ending with first public success.
  2) Ascent vs. Investigation (2012–13) ending with the medical leak.
  3) Collapse (2013–14) ending with a failed attempt at control (Cosmos Club).
  4) Reckoning/Aftermath (2015–16; 2021) tying Peter’s language to what follows.
- Move the 1946 ledger earlier as foreshadowing (end of Part 1), so its relevance to the Heritage Center is paid off later.
- Consolidate or trim 10–15% of transitional pages where characters restate the thesis. Redirect that space to two face-to-face confrontations: Peter/Rosa (once mid-book, once late) and Peter/Felicity (a private truth scene).

## Prose and Style

Strengths:
- Sensory detail is exceptional. Lemon oil and old marble, humidity as pressure, the sounds and smells of rooms and streets—these build authority.
- Dialogue carries subtext, especially in power rooms. Ray’s patter, The Senator’s measured menace, and Felicity’s precision work.
- Humor bites without becoming slapstick; the “plantation cosplay” line is a good example of tone held in check.

Weaknesses:
- The metaphor density is high. Long chains of similes can stall the scene and produce reader fatigue.
- Lists and riffs sometimes repeat (humidity, bourbon, magnolias, lemon oil recur so often they start to feel like tics).
- A few speechifying passages tell us what to think rather than letting the scene earn it.

Actionable suggestions:
- For each chapter, cut one-third of nonessential metaphors. Keep the image that serves character or stakes; lose the one that lands as a wisecrack.
- Vary sentence length more aggressively. Insert periodic short, plain sentences to reset the reader’s ear during dense paragraphs.
- Build a style sheet of repeated images and cap their use (e.g., “lemon oil” appears X times across the book). Force yourself to find fresher, simpler beats in later chapters.
- Where you have commentary, see if a physical action can carry it. Example: instead of “power insulating itself from natural consequences,” show Ray raising the AC two degrees before donors arrive while staff shiver.

## World-Building and Setting

Strengths:
- The book knows its rooms. Hotels, green rooms, K Street, the Cosmos Club, City Hall, shelters, warehouses—each feels specific.
- The institutions feel real: think-tank ecosystems, donor expectations, FOIA mechanics, how campaigns handle a leak.

Weaknesses:
- Acronyms and entity names stack up. The Restored South Leadership Council, Felicity’s think tank, Heritage Center, shell orgs—readers can get lost in the institutional roster.
- Some procedural detail (e.g., policy presentations) tips toward info-dump and slows narrative drive.

Actionable suggestions:
- Add a front-matter “Cast and Institutions” page for quick reference. Two lines per organization with function and key players will save readers cognitive load.
- Use strategic signposting in headers: “Restored South HQ, K Street – June 2011,” “Heritage Center, St. Florentine – Jan 2008.”
- In policy-heavy rooms, cut internal jargon and condense to the choice that will cost someone something. Give us decisions, not decks.

## Theme

Strengths:
- Clear, resonant themes: the monetization of nostalgia; how “restoration” becomes license; the cost of complicity; bodies as ledgers of moral debt; disaster capitalism; the pipeline from respectable rhetoric to violence.
- Recurring motifs (flags, gavels, staged heritage, humidity) reinforce the themes.

Weaknesses:
- The thematic message sometimes arrives pre-chewed. The narrative can feel didactic when a simpler image would suffice.
- The darkness is nearly unrelieved. Without moments of genuine grace or complexity in “the opposition,” the book risks preaching to the choir.

Actionable suggestions:
- Seed a few small, unearned acts of kindness or doubt among the movement actors—an aide who quietly helps a protester; The Senator showing tenderness with a grandchild that unnerves Peter. Not to excuse them, but to complicate the moral field.
- Give Rosa a cost beyond professional risk. Who does she lose, and why does she keep going? Make that cost visible to give the theme weight over righteousness.
- Decide Peter’s end-state thematically. Is this a tragedy of self-knowledge (he sees it too late), or of denial (he never sees)? Either works; choosing clarifies the last movement’s tone.
- Consider one moment where Peter could break the chain—even in a small way—and show him choosing not to. That choice is your theme in action.

Bottom line: You have a rich, forceful novel with sharp characters and a persuasive world. Your task now is to simplify the path through it without dulling the edges. Lead the reader by the hand through time and voice; let scenes carry judgments; and give your antagonists the depth that makes their danger feel earned. With targeted cuts, a firmer spine, and a touch more air in the prose, Excellency can land as both a gripping story and a clear-eyed diagnosis.

* Distinct, energetic voices and confident use of documentary forms (dossiers, transcripts, memos) that add texture and authenticity
* Deep, compelling characterization—complex Peter, principled Rosa, formidable Felicity—supported by a credible, well-populated bench
* Strong narrative architecture with a clear grooming→ascent→leak→fall trajectory, logical investigative escalation, and vivid set-pieces
* Evocative craft: exceptional sensory detail, subtext-rich dialogue, and convincing, well-researched settings and institutions

---

## Key Areas for Development

* Clarify the core throughline and stakes (center the story on Peter vs. Rosa, choose the primary promise in Act One, and treat 2021 as culmination tied to earlier choices)
* Streamline structure and POV (establish a consistent POV pattern, add clear time/place headers, smooth time jumps, and recast intrusive analysis as diegetic documents)
* Deepen key characters and causality (humanize Eugene and Felicity, put Marcus on the page earlier, and sharpen Tony’s causal arc with clear beats)
* Tighten prose and modulate tone (reduce metaphor density and on-the-nose commentary, vary sentence length, and let physical action carry judgments)
* Reduce institutional sprawl and info load (trim/clarify org acronyms, avoid policy info-dumps, and focus scenes on consequential decisions)

## Market Potential

This documentary-tinged political novel—braiding dark-money politics, media ecosystems, and a family fractured by ambition—aligns well with current interest in sociopolitical fiction and should appeal to readers of Trust, The Topeka School, and The Plot Against America. Market potential is strong among literary and narrative nonfiction–crossover audiences and policy-adjacent book clubs; tightening the Peter–Rosa throughline and making the 2021 material a clear culmination will mitigate risks of density and tonal saturation and improve broader reach and word-of-mouth.

---

## Final Recommendations

Excellency is a bold, timely novel with vivid scenes, confident voices, and a lived-in world; its core—Peter’s need to matter set against Rosa’s pursuit of truth and a rising machine—has real power and clear potential. To lift it further, focus on three things: first, lock the spine around Peter vs. Rosa and smooth the timeline so the 2021 material lands as culmination, not a new thread; second, set a steady POV pattern and clear scene headers to guide the reader through time and voice; third, tighten the prose and deepen a few key characters so scenes carry the judgment. Concrete next steps: map the book into four parts (grooming; ascent vs. investigation; collapse; reckoning) and move the 1946 ledger to the end of Part 1; establish a simple POV rhythm (e.g., Peter chapters, Rosa chapters, clearly labeled interludes), add date/place tags, and turn “Chapter 5 Analysis” into an in-story memo; cut 10–15% of repeated material and about a third of the extra metaphors, replacing one on-the-nose paragraph per chapter with a physical beat; add one early Marcus scene, three clean Tony beats (loss, first contact, activation), and one private moment each where Eugene and Felicity’s guard slips; tie the convoy directly to language and choices seeded earlier; consider a brief “Cast and Institutions” page to reduce acronym load. You have the authority and heart; with a firmer throughline, steadier scaffolding, and a touch more air, this can land as both gripping story and clear-eyed diagnosis—well within your reach.
