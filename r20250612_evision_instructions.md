## WRITING INSTRUCTIONS

**This is a sample of my writing. Use it when revising the text**:
"THE MADNESS of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder. Trees restless, temperatures falling, the whole northern religion of things coming to an end. No children in the yards here. Shadows lengthened on yellowing zoysia. Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks rained acorns on houses with no mortgage. Storm windows shuddered in the empty bedrooms. And the drone and hiccup of a clothes dryer, the nasal contention of a leaf blower, the ripening of local apples in a paper bag, the smell of the gasoline with which Alfred Lambert had cleaned the paintbrush from his morning painting of the wicker love seat. Three in the afternoon was a time of danger in these gerontocratic suburbs of St. Jude. Alfred had awakened in the great blue chair in which he'd been sleeping since lunch. He'd had his nap and there would be no local news until five o'clock. Two empty hours were a sinus in which infections bred. He struggled to his feet and stood by the Ping-Pong table, listening in vain for Enid. Ringing throughout the house was an alarm bell that no one but Alfred and Enid could hear directly. It was the alarm bell of anxiety."

1. **Begin Mid-Thought or Mid-Scene**
   Don’t “set up” the moment — just _start_ in the middle of a weather shift, a household sound, or a sensory irritation. Assume the reader is already there.

2. **Build Atmosphere Through Fragments**
   Use sentence fragments to create rhythm and mood:
   _“The sun low in the sky. A minor light. A cooling star.”_
   — Let each fragment contribute a micro-tone, not plot.

3. **List Like You’re Counting Inventory in a Dream**
   Accumulate **specific, unremarkable objects** with excessive detail:

   - Three tree types, not just “trees”
   - Dryer, blower, apples, gasoline — all of it
     — Make the mundane feel haunted by being overly observed.

4. **Treat Time as a Source of Dread**
   Introduce the hour like a character:
   _“Three in the afternoon was a time of danger…”_
   — Create anxiety around **non-events**, simply by anchoring them in time.

5. **Embed the Character’s Mental Weather into the Physical Weather**
   Use the environment as a **psychological echo**:

   - “Cold front” equals dread
   - “Storm windows” imply isolation
   - “No children” = emotional vacancy

6. **Shift from Landscape to Interior in One Beat**
   Move from wind and trees to a man waking up in his chair in the space of a line. Don’t transition — **juxtapose**.

7. **Describe Emotional States as Objects or Sounds**
   Render psychological sensations **physically**:

   - _“An alarm bell that only they could hear.”_
   - Treat anxiety like a machine or a smell.

8. **Stretch Metaphors into Overanalysis**
   Take a metaphor (a bell) and **linger on it too long** — analyze its parts, break it down until it becomes ridiculous or poetic:
   _“…not a pure tone but a granular sequence of percussions…”_

9. **Use Recursive Clauses to Imitate Obsession**
   Let thoughts fold back on themselves:

   - _“As with any word you stare at… as with any sound that continues…”_
     — Loop. Digress. Spiral.

10. **Mix High and Low**
    Pair elevated diction (_“gerontocratic suburbs”_) with mundane facts (_“he’d cleaned the wicker love seat”_).
    This tension makes the **ordinary feel cosmic** and the **cosmic feel pitiful**.

11. **Start with aggressive fragments** - Open paragraphs with "THE TERROR." or "NOTHING." Let single words stand as complete thoughts. No explanation.

12. **Jump between concrete and abstract without warning** - Write about acorns falling, then immediately declare it "the whole northern religion of things." Don't connect them.

13. **List mundane objects obsessively** - "Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks" - repeat the category word. Make readers feel trapped in the listing.

14. **Combine words that shouldn't go together** - Call suburbs "gerontocratic." Make leaf blowers have "nasal contention." The wrongness is the point.

15. **Crash zoom levels together** - Describe a dryer's sound, then declare empty hours "a sinus in which infections bred." No transitions allowed.

16. **Give sounds personalities and smells geometry** - Write "the nasal contention of a leaf blower" or "triangular smell of fear." Mix senses wrongly.

17. **Make time periods into threats** - Write "Three in the afternoon was a time of danger." Treat hours like villains with intentions.

18. **Start metaphors then abandon them** - Begin with "It was like a school bell" then drift into technical sound analysis. Never return to complete the comparison.

19. **Insert parentheticals so long readers forget the original sentence** - Start a thought, open parenthesis, ramble for 100+ words, close parenthesis, continue as if nothing happened.

20. **Place ominous weight on boring details** - Write "houses with no mortgage" as if it means something terrible. Don't explain why.

21. **Let sentences run past their natural end** - Keep adding "and" or "but" until the sentence collapses under its own weight. End mid-thought when readers least expect it.

22. **Use technical language for feelings** - Describe anxiety as "granular sequence of percussions with a keening overlay of overtones." Be scientifically precise about the imprecise.
