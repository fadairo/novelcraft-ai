Full Report
========================================================================
Please note: this document adopts the structure and tone of a Faber Academy Full Report. Every manuscript is different and the observations below are tailored to your project. If future drafts need to focus on anything specific, just let us know.

SYNOPSIS
========================================================================
A shy baker enters a cut-throat baking contest and discovers resilience.

OVERVIEW
========================================================================
• 2 chapter(s) revised out of 2; 1/2 hit their word-count targets.
• Total word-count change: -50 words (from 3,100 to 3,050).
• Voice, pacing and structure are stronger overall. A small number of chapters would still benefit from a polish pass to smooth scene transitions and reinforce key themes.

CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER NOTES
========================================================================
Below are concise observations on each revised chapter:
   • Chapter  1: 1,500 → 1,400 words (-100; ON TARGET)
   • Chapter  2: 1,600 → 1,650 words (+50; OFF TARGET)

PROCESS & METHODOLOGY
========================================================================
1. Analysis — Each chapter was reviewed for story arc, character development and stylistic consistency.
2. Planning — A chapter-specific plan (maintain / expand / trim) was drafted to hit precise word-count objectives while raising overall literary quality.
3. Revision — Text was rewritten line-by-line, cross-checking against adjacent chapters for continuity.
4. Quality Control — Automated checks verified final word counts and ensured no AI commentary leaked into the prose.

NEXT STEPS
========================================================================
• Read the revised material aloud — a quick way to spot rhythm issues.
• Flag any plot or character points that feel inconsistent so they can be addressed in the next pass.
• Consider revising adjacent chapters to maintain tonal coherence.
• Update your outline to reflect the structural changes introduced here.

SUMMARY
========================================================================
Most structural and stylistic issues have now been addressed. A targeted final pass—especially on chapters that drifted off target—should leave the manuscript submission-ready. Good luck with your next draft!
