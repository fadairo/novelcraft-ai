# A SEASON OF SPIES - REVISED SYNOPSIS

In the autumn-shadowed halls of Cambridge University Library, retired historian Dr. Henry Millbank discovers a cryptic message that resurrects the ghosts he thought buried with the Cold War. The note, deliberately placed for him to find, references Operation Glasshouse—a conspiracy that spans decades and continents, implicating his former MI6 handler in a web of betrayal that reaches into the present day. As Henry pursues the truth through Prague's rain-slicked archives and London's corridors of power, he is haunted not only by his past choices but by the spectral presence of his wife Margaret, whose advancing dementia serves as both cruel metaphor and tender reminder of all that memory can steal and preserve.

What begins as a search for a legendary defector known as Orpheus becomes an excavation of the moral compromises that define both nations and marriages. Henry's investigation draws in his estranged journalist son Thomas, whose parallel pursuit of corruption offers a chance for reconciliation even as it threatens to expose truths that could destabilize international relations. Aided by Elena Rostova—a Russian operative whose own loyalties prove as fluid as the boundaries between enemy and ally—Henry must navigate a labyrinth where personal redemption and professional duty collide. In prose that echoes the melancholy elegance of le Carré and the moral complexity of Greene, the novel interrogates whether the pursuit of truth can justify its cost when those we love become collateral damage.

At its heart, *A Season of Spies* is less about the mechanics of espionage than about the archaeology of conscience—how the secrets we keep shape the people we become, and how the past's unquiet dead demand their reckoning. As Henry races toward a climactic confrontation at a London trade summit, he must choose between preserving the comfortable lies that protect nations and embracing the devastating truths that might set us free. The novel asks whether, in a world built on deception, the greatest act of loyalty might be betrayal itself.
