# Prologue

Prague, December 1989

Snow fell in wet clumps over Prague, transforming the carefully mapped escape routes into a maze of white uncertainty. Henry Millbank stood at the frost-etched window of the safe house, a third-floor walk-up in Malá Strana where the wallpaper peeled like dead skin from ancient wounds. His breath clouded the glass as he checked his watch again: 2245 hours. Fifteen minutes until either triumph or catastrophe.

The city below seemed to hold its breath. Three weeks since the Wall came down in Berlin, and still the old reflexes persisted—curtains drawn tight, footsteps muffled, conversations conducted in whispers. Revolution might have swept through Wenceslas Square, but in these narrow streets beneath the castle, shadows still kept their Cold War secrets.

Henry spread the operational plans across the safe house's scarred desk one final time, his fingers tracing the route he'd memorized weeks ago in Cartwright's oak-paneled office. The fountain pen annotations were still crisp in the margins: "2300 - Primary arrives with WINTER. Vehicle transfer at Point Echo. K & B standing by with papers + modified vehicle." Simple arrows marked their passage west—narrow roads through dense forest, each checkpoint and camera noted, each potential choke point accounted for. Six hours to the Austrian border, assuming perfect execution.

Too perfect. In Berlin, the best plans always had margin notes full of doubts, contingencies scrawled in haste, alternative routes sketched with coffee-stained fingers. Cartwright's annotations read like a manual written by someone who'd never felt snow melt through worn shoe leather or tasted fear metallic on the tongue. The precision of it made Henry's teeth ache.

He'd run similar extractions a dozen times, back when the Wall still divided the world into neat ideological halves. The methodology was sound, each step built on proven tradecraft. Yet something in the plan's very precision made his shoulder blades itch. Like a stage set that looked perfect until you noticed the paint was still wet.

Margaret would be reading in their Cambridge flat, unaware her husband stood at the edge of an abyss. Tom, barely sixteen, probably bent over homework in his dormitory, dreaming of anything but his absent father's work. Another missed birthday last month, another promise to be home for Christmas that tasted like ash even as Henry made it.

His watch showed 2250. Ten minutes until Orpheus's arrival. Through the window, snow transformed the carefully plotted escape route into an alien landscape. Henry folded the plans with mechanical precision, each crease as sharp as the line between success and failure. The paper whispered between his fingers like autumn leaves anticipating winter.

This wasn't just another defector. Orpheus carried thirty years of Soviet intelligence methodology in his head, names and networks that could rewrite the history of the Cold War's final act. But more than that—he claimed to have documents proving Operation Glasshouse wasn't a single failed coup but a web of manipulations stretching from Moscow to London, with threads that led directly to Whitehall's most secure offices. The kind of intelligence that made careers or destroyed them, that shifted the balance of power in conference rooms where wars were planned with teacups and careful euphemisms.

Behind him, the radio crackled with Keller's check-in from the garage. "Echo One in position." Old Jim's voice carried the steady assurance that had made him legendary in Berlin Station. The kind of man who could walk through Checkpoint Charlie with contraband in his briefcase and paradise in his papers, whistling Beethoven.

"Acknowledged." Henry's eyes tracked a black Volvo moving too slowly for the weather, its wipers keeping metronome time with his pulse. The Volvo's driver sat too straight, shoulders squared with military rigidity despite his civilian coat. His hands gripped the wheel at precisely ten and two, never shifting position even as the car crawled through the snow. Only his head moved, mechanical sweeps left to right every twelve seconds, marking grid coordinates on some internal surveillance map. A cigarette burned untouched in his ashtray, smoke rising in an unnatural column that no casual driver would ignore.

WINTER's signature. The KGB officer who'd turned surveillance into art form, who could orchestrate a grab team like a conductor with a baton. Three years Henry had tracked him through Eastern Europe, always arriving too late, finding only the shells of burned safe houses and the bitter taste of operations gone wrong.

"Echo Two, ready." Blackwood's words cut through the static, each syllable clipped with the same precision she'd once used to diagram Old English verbs at Oxford. Six months ago, she would have added something human—a joke, a complaint about the cold. But field work had stripped such flourishes from her voice, leaving only the essentials. Through the encrypted line, Henry heard the soft click of her safety being checked. She would be positioned exactly three meters from the garage's north entrance, Browning at her hip, diplomatic papers folded in her breast pocket with the same meticulous care she'd once given to her doctoral thesis.

Both of them trusting him. Both of them believing in the clean simplicity of Cartwright's plan.

Henry turned from the window, surveying their cover once more. Books and papers scattered across a worn desk—the careful disorder of an academic researching Czech architectural history. A half-empty bottle of Becherovka and two glasses, as if he'd been entertaining a colleague. All of it precisely wrong, like a stage set arranged by someone who'd only read about scholars in surveillance reports. The room held its breath around him, waiting for the next move in this elaborate game of make-believe.

The second Volvo appeared at 2257, ghosting through the snow like a mirror image of the first. Both cars drifted past the safe house at precisely the same speed, their wipers marking identical arcs through the gathering white. A chess game played with three-ton pieces, and Henry suddenly understood he wasn't a player but a pawn.

The precision of Cartwright's plan crystallized into clarity. Not a trap for mice, but a gift-wrapped offering to WINTER. Every detail too clean, every timing too perfect. The kind of operation you designed when you wanted it to fail in exactly the right way.

Henry pressed the radio transmit button. "Echo One, possible compromise." 

The earpiece hissed static. He tried again, tasting copper as he bit the inside of his cheek. "Echo Two, Echo One, respond."

Nothing. The silence stretched for three endless minutes—enough time for WINTER's men to blanket the area in electronic darkness, to close every exit, to position themselves with the same mechanical precision as Cartwright's annotations.

At 2303, headlights cut through the snow. Right on schedule, as if reading from a script. But the car was wrong—a black Mercedes instead of the agreed Škoda. WINTER sat behind the wheel, his face blank as fresh paper, hands at ten and two. The passenger door opened, and Orpheus emerged into the swirling white.

Even from three floors up, Henry could see what made this defector worth kingdoms. Orpheus moved with the liquid grace of a man who'd survived forty years in the intelligence wilderness. His hawk nose cut through the swirling snow, and when he turned toward the safe house, a gold signet ring caught the streetlight—the recognition signal from the photographs. But it was his eyes that held Henry frozen. Even at this distance, they burned with intelligence that had memorized a thousand secrets, witnessed the machinery of history grinding forward, and decided to throw sand in its gears.

Their eyes met through the window. A lifetime of survival distilled into a single glance. Orpheus's lips moved, shaping words lost in the distance and snow. Then his head tilted slightly—the universal gesture of a chess player recognizing checkmate.

The first shot punched through the glass beside Henry's head. Others followed in a precise sequence—one-two-three—forces moving into pre-arranged positions like actors hitting their marks. From the garage came the sharp bark of Keller's pistol, then Blackwood's higher-pitched Browning, then nothing. The silence that followed was worse than gunfire.

WINTER was already gone, melted into the darkness between muzzle flashes. But Orpheus stood motionless in the orange cone of a streetlight, snow settling on his shoulders like ermine on a deposed king. His polished accent carried over the muffled sounds of what was certainly a massacre in the garage.

"The winter markets, Mr. Millbank," he called out, his voice carrying the music of Moscow salons and Siberian winters. "Third stall from the bridge, where the clockmaker sells time. When the river ice breaks, the swans return." He lifted his collar against the snow, a gesture Henry would remember with photographic clarity—thumb and forefinger pinching the fabric, a half-turn of the wrist, elegant as a magician's flourish. Then he stepped into darkness and vanished between one heartbeat and the next.

Three minutes of silence. In Berlin, three minutes meant blown covers, burnt safe houses, and bodies in the Spree. Here it meant Cartwright had handed them to WINTER wrapped in a bow, probably in exchange for something that would look like diplomatic victory in tomorrow's Times. Keller and Blackwood's names would appear in no official record, their bodies likely already being loaded into anonymous vans. Collateral damage in games played in oak-paneled rooms.

Henry pressed himself against ancient stonework, feeling centuries of grime against his cheek. The weight of the folded plans in his pocket felt like thirty pieces of silver. Down the servants' stairs, through a door that opened onto an alley barely wide enough for a man to pass. Left on Josefská, right into the shadow of St. Nicholas Church, down worn steps slick with fresh powder. Each turn erased by falling snow. Past shuttered shops where mannequins stood witness behind frosted glass. Through courtyards where his footprints disappeared almost as quickly as he made them.

The protocols kicked in, muscle memory overriding thought. Change your silhouette—he ditched his coat, reversed his jacket. Alter your gait—a slight limp, favoring the left leg. Break up your pattern—double back twice, enter a building through one door and exit through another. All the while, Orpheus's words echoed in the rhythm of his footsteps. Winter markets. Clockmaker. Swans.

By the time he reached the tram station, Henry had become someone else—a tired worker heading home from night shift, shoulders slumped with exhaustion rather than failure. The first tram rattled past without stopping, then another. When the third finally opened its doors, Henry climbed aboard among a handful of other shadows fleeing the night.

The eastern sky had begun to lighten, painting the castle's silhouette against purple-grey clouds. Somewhere behind him, smoke would be rising from a burning garage, the flames consuming whatever evidence Keller and Blackwood might have carried. In London, Cartwright would be arriving at his desk in exactly two hours, Fortnum's tea cooling beside morning signals from Prague, each carefully edited cable adding another brushstroke to tomorrow's carefully managed history.

Henry closed his eyes, seeing Orpheus's gesture again—that elegant lift of the collar. A man who'd played similar games for longer than Henry had been alive, who understood that sometimes the only way to win was to vanish from the board entirely. Thirty pieces of silver in Henry's pocket, two good people dead, and somewhere in Prague, a defector who'd slipped through everyone's fingers with a message about winter markets and swans.

By dawn he'd be on a plane to London. By evening, sitting across from Cartwright's mahogany desk, watching those manicured fingers steeple as they crafted a story of bad luck and blown covers. Henry would nod in all the right places, sign all the right forms, and begin the long game of pretending to believe. But first, he would stop at a phone box near the airport and place a call to Cambridge. Margaret would answer on the third ring, voice thick with sleep, and he would tell her he loved her. He would promise to be home for Christmas. And this time, for once in his life of necessary lies, he would mean it.

The tram curved along the river, where ice was already forming at the edges despite the mild winter. No swans yet—they would come with the spring thaw, when the world turned again and secrets frozen in winter darkness finally came to light. Henry pulled the collar of his stolen jacket higher, unconsciously mimicking Orpheus's gesture, and settled in for the long journey home.
