    "synopsis": "## Project Information\n\n- **Title:** A Season of Spies\n- **Author:** Figs\n- **Genre:** Literary Thriller / Spy Fiction\n- **Target Word Count:** 80,000 - 90,000 words\n- **Setting:** Cambridge, Prague, London, Rural France (Contemporary with Cold War flashbacks)\n\n## One-Line Summary\n\nIn the damp streets of Cambridge, a retired academic discovers a cryptic message in a borrowed book, plunging him into a world of espionage where he must navigate old friendships, Cold War secrets, and new alliances.\n\n## Story Synopsis\n\nDr. Henry Millbank, a 71-year-old retired historian and former MI6 Cold War operative, discovers a cryptic note in a library book that references \"Operation Glasshouse\" and a defector codenamed _Orpheus_. The note, deliberately placed by Russian operative Elena Rostova, draws Henry back into the world of espionage he thought he'd left behind.\n\nAs Henry investigates alongside his wife Margaret, who suffers from early-stage dementia, he uncovers a conspiracy involving his former MI6 handler David Cartwright and learns that _Orpheus_ is alive, possessing documents that could expose decades of intelligence manipulation. When Henry's journalist son Thomas independently investigates related corruption, father and son must work together to uncover the truth.\n\nThe investigation culminates at a London trade summit where Henry must choose between protecting national interests and exposing the corruption, with _Orpheus_'s fate—and international stability—hanging in the balance.\n\n## Main Characters\n\n### Dr. Henry Millbank\n\n- **Age:** 71\n- **Role:** Protagonist - Retired historian and former MI6 operative\n- **Description:** Intelligent, reflective, and loyal, struggling with guilt over past decisions and his wife's declining health\n- **Motivation:** Seeking redemption and truth while protecting those he loves\n\n### Margaret Millbank\n\n- **Age:** 69\n- **Role:** Henry's wife and emotional anchor\n- **Description:** Warm, witty retired English teacher with early-stage dementia\n- **Motivation:** Supporting Henry while maintaining dignity despite her illness\n\n### Elena Rostova\n\n- **Age:** 35\n- **Role:** Russian SVR operative posing as Cambridge student\n- **Description:** Intelligent, pragmatic, and enigmatic with divided loyalties\n- **Motivation:** Exposing intelligence corruption while protecting _Orpheus_\n\n### Thomas \"Tom\" Millbank\n\n- **Age:** 38\n- **Role:** Henry's son, investigative journalist\n- **Description:** Idealistic and driven, pursuing independent investigation\n- **Motivation:** Uncovering corruption and reconciling with his father\n\n### _Orpheus_\n\n- **Age:** Early 70s\n- **Role:** Former KGB defector living under assumed identity\n- **Description:** Charismatic but morally ambiguous, possesses damaging documents\n- **Motivation:** Exposing intelligence abuses while protecting his freedom\n\n### David Cartwright\n\n- **Age:** 60s\n- **Role:** Henry's former MI6 handler, now senior advisor\n- **Description:** Manipulative and self-serving, working to suppress truth\n- **Motivation:** Protecting his position and national interests at any cost\n\n## Key Themes\n\n- **Memory and Loss:** Margaret's dementia parallels Henry's struggle with the past\n- **Moral Ambiguity:** The tension between duty, truth, and personal loyalty\n- **Generational Conflict:** Clash between Henry's cynicism and Tom's idealism\n- **The Cost of Truth:** Whether exposing corruption justifies the consequences\n- **Loyalty and Betrayal:** Complex relationships in the intelligence world\n\n## Four-Act Structure\n\n### Act I: The Discovery\n\n- Henry finds the cryptic note in library book\n- Contact from former handler David Cartwright\n- Decision to investigate despite Margaret's condition\n\n### Act II: The Investigation\n\n- Travel to Prague following clues\n- Encounters with Elena Rostova\n- Discovery of Operation Glasshouse conspiracy\n- Tom's parallel investigation begins\n\n### Act III: The Confrontation\n\n- Truth about Cartwright's betrayal revealed\n- Father-son reconciliation and collaboration\n- Location of _Orpheus_ discovered\n- Build-up to London trade summit\n\n### Act IV: The Resolution\n\n- Climactic decision at trade summit\n- Henry chooses truth over stability\n- _Orpheus_ disappears with Elena's help\n- Return to quiet life with Margaret\n\n## Setting Details\n\n### Cambridge, England\n\nHistoric university town with cobbled streets, grand libraries, and ivy-covered colleges.
