## One-Line Summary

In the damp streets of Cambridge, a retired academic discovers a cryptic message in a borrowed book, plunging him into a world of espionage where he must navigate old friendships, Cold War secrets, and new alliances.

## Story Synopsis

Dr. Henry Millbank, a 71-year-old retired historian and former MI6 Cold War operative, discovers a cryptic note in a library book that references "Operation Glasshouse" and a defector codenamed _Orpheus_. The note, deliberately placed by Russian operative Elena Rostova, draws Henry back into the world of espionage he thought he'd left behind.

As Henry investigates alongside his wife Margaret, who suffers from early-stage dementia, he uncovers a conspiracy involving his former MI6 handler David Cartwright and learns that _Orpheus_ is alive, possessing documents that could expose decades of intelligence manipulation. When Henry's journalist son Thomas independently investigates related corruption, father and son must work together to uncover the truth.

The investigation culminates at a London trade summit where Henry must choose between protecting national interests and exposing the corruption, with _Orpheus_'s fate—and international stability—hanging in the balance.
