Chapter 5

The impact had triggered a brief blackout, that disorienting detachment of mind from body. When Henry's awareness returned, he found himself cradling Margaret's head, her blonde curls dampened with a trickle of blood. 

"Margaret?" His voice quivered with panic. "Can you hear me, love?"

Her eyelids fluttered open, blue eyes clouded in confusion. "What happened?"

Relief washed over him, though he knew her memory could be short-lived. "You took a nasty fall. Just lie still."

Carefully, he lifted her from the floor, her fragile form easily supported by the former soldier's muscles shaped by decades of country walks and garden labor. He carried her to the sofa, arranging her head gently on the cushions.

"I'll fetch the medical kit." Leaving her side pained him, but the cut on her temple required attention.

In the adjacent study, he retrieved the red bag stuffed with bandages and antiseptic – remnants of a life he thought he'd left behind. While cleaning and dressing Margaret's wound, his thoughts drifted to that encrypted message buried in the library book. Hidden in plain sight, a summons from the past he could no longer ignore. Whatever Cartwright and his cohorts were scheming, Henry had been thrust back into that twilight world, whether he wished it or not.

How could he protect Margaret when his own faculties were compromised by age? The fall would undoubtedly accelerate her decline, the blow exacerbating that steady unraveling of memories they'd fought so valiantly to preserve.

He secured the bandage with a practiced efficiency, then braced himself for the questions he knew would come.

"Why am I on the sofa?" Margaret's voice carried that slightly petulant tone of a child roused from a nap. "I was making tea, wasn't I?"

Henry smiled, that warm, patient smile that over the years had become as natural as breathing. "You had a bit of an accident, my dear. You'll be quite all right, I promise."

She studied him with those limpid eyes, searching for recognition, for the narrative threads that bound her world. How cruel this bloody disease, stealing her away from him one vanishing day at a time.

"I think..." Her brow furrowed. "I think I need to rest."

"Of course." Henry leaned forward, stroking her hair. "Rest now. I'll look after everything."

Alone again, he stared at his hands – those weathered instruments that had once fired rifles and tended wounds. Now they simply clung to the remnants of a fading life, as temporary as everything touched by time's indifferent decay.

The private line rang, shrill against the stillness. Likely Cartwright demanding his presence, that cultured baritone masking ulterior motives. For a heartbeat, Henry considered feigning ignorance, retreating into this sheltered existence with Margaret.

But the summons from _Orpheus_ had awoken something in him, that cold determination which had lain dormant for decades. He would get to the truth – not for Queen and Country, but for the fragile treasure sleeping on the sofa, for the man he had once been and the one he might become again.

With a steadying breath, he answered the call.

Later that afternoon, Henry stood vigil beside Margaret's bed, watching her chest rise and fall with the rhythmic tide of slumber. The painkillers had rendered her insensible to the world, sparing her the indignity of disorientation, if only for a few blessed hours.

So much of their history lay inscribed in this room – the faded quilts stitched by her grandmother, the dog-eared novels consuming the bedside table, the old oak dresser containing the artifacts of their lives. A museum of memories slowly being dismantled, like an exhibition closing one treasure at a time.

A soft knock came from the door, followed by the familiar voice. "Everything all right, Dad?"

Henry turned to find Thomas lingering in the hallway, hands shoved in his pockets in that way of his – always the respectful observer, even in his own childhood home.

"She's resting comfortably." The lie came easier than he would have liked. How could he burden his son with this fresh anguish, on top of everything else he must shoulder?

Thomas nodded, his journalism instincts no doubt detecting the omission. Always the empath, their Thomas – a quality that served him well in the trade, but also rendered him vulnerable to its soul-eroding demands.

"I spoke with Rami," he offered. "Said he'd look into those names from the archive. Could be a few days before he gets back to me."

Another invisible string, tying Thomas to the intrigue Henry had hoped to leave behind them.

"I appreciate your persistence, son, but I'm not certain it's wise to pursue this any further." The words felt like a betrayal, but he had to consider Margaret's well-being. Losing him to the menace of his former life would be a cruelty she could never comprehend.

Thomas opened his mouth to protest, then seemed to reconsider. A fragile truce passed between them – the understanding that some paths, once traveled, can never be retraced. With a curt nod, he retreated down the corridor, his footsteps gradually receding.

Alone with Margaret once more, Henry settled into the chair beside her bed, listening to the measured cadence of her breathing. So much had already been taken from them by this damnable disease. Whatever blood price the past demanded, he could not permit it to claim what little remained of the woman he loved.

His fingers found the contours of the golden band encircling his finger – a simple strip of metal that had marked the odyssey of their lives together. Out the window, twilight seeped across the heavens in shades of indigo and ember. Soon, the dark conspiratorial blanket under which such deeds were born would engulf them all.

But not tonight. Tonight, he would hold vigil over the only truth that mattered, guarding the poetry of this ordinary love from the complicated lies of men.
