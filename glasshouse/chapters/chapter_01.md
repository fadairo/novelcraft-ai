# Chapter 1

The University Library loomed against the October sky, a monument of rigid certainties rendered in Portland stone and leaded glass, its tower reaching upward with the cold precision of an era that still believed in absolute truths. Henry Millbank stood at its base, feeling the weight of decades press against him like autumn mist, while memories shifted through his consciousness with the same restless energy as the fallen leaves skittering across West Road.
Around him, the afternoon light painted Cambridge in shades of amber and bronze, each shadow a reminder of time's relentless passage, each gleam of sunlight a reflection of choices long past.



      In his mind, Margaret walked a step behind him, her presence as familiar as his own heartbeat, as uncertain as morning fog. He'd grown accustomed to these conversations with her younger self, these dialogues between present loneliness and past joy, each one a small betrayal of reality that somehow felt more honest than truth. The Margaret who walked with him here existed in a perfect autumn afternoon sometime in the 1970s, her dark hair untouched by grey, her eyes bright with the sharp wit that had first drawn him to her across a crowded supervision room, where youth still believed in the permanence of love and the infallibility of memory.




      "You're procrastinating," she said in his thoughts, her voice carrying that gentle mockery he'd preserved like pressed flowers between the pages of remembrance. "First- years are braver about entering than you are today."




      A young woman hurried past him, her laptop bag a modern intrusion against the timeless stonework, her carefully curated dishevelment a reminder of how fashion cycled through the generations like seasons. Henry watched her take the steps two at a time, each bound a small rebellion against gravity and age, a casual display of energy that



belonged to a world he'd left behind as surely as he'd left behind the man he'd once been - the man who had moved through shadows and certainties with equal conviction.




      The library's silence enveloped him like a familiar coat, not the absolute quiet of empty rooms, but the living silence of concentrated thought. Pages whispered their ancient secrets, keyboards tapped out modern revelations, and somewhere in the vast space, a cough echoed off the vaulted ceiling like a question mark punctuating the afternoon's scholarly meditation. Henry moved through it all like a ghost haunting his own past, his fingers trailing along book spines that felt like the vertebrae of history itself.




      His Margaret's presence, more felt than imagined, provided her usual commentary, each observation a bridge between who they had been and what remained. "It's quieter than I expected," she murmured in his thoughts, and he could picture her tilting her head to take in the vaulted ceiling, a gesture so familiar it ached. "Not even the sound of shoes squeaking on the floor."



      Henry caught himself before speaking aloud, though a student at a nearby table had already looked up, her face showing that particular mixture of curiosity and concern reserved for elderly men who appeared lost in their own worlds. The girl's eyes held the same uncomprehending kindness he sometimes saw in the nurses who visited their home, that gentle dismissal of age that youth wore like armor. He pretended to examine a book until she returned to her work, conscious of how these moments must appear to others - an old man wandering the stacks, having conversations with ghosts and memories.




      In his mind, Margaret chuckled, the sound as rich and warm as steeped tea, a comfort he had treasured through decades of deceptions and half-truths. "Still the same old Henry. You think books are sacred and everything else is noise."




      "Books are sacred," he thought, stopping to inspect a particularly worn volume in the history section. The leather binding was cracked and smoothed by countless hands, like the faces of old spies weathered by years of maintained fictions. He tilted his head to read the title--something about Byzantine trade routes--and returned it to its place.



"You wouldn't understand. You always picked the flimsy ones."




      "Flimsy!" His mind's Margaret laughed, that warm, familiar sound that made his chest tighten even in memory. "You mean poetry? I seem to remember you sneaking a copy of Rilke into your bag once. 'Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' hierarchies?' You thought it might help you understand the human heart better. Did it?"




      The question hung in his consciousness like smoke, a reminder of all the times he'd chosen observation over understanding, analysis over emotion. The real Margaret was at home in their terrace house, likely sitting in her favorite chair by the window, lost in whatever mist had claimed her thoughts today. But here, in the filtered light of the library where dust motes danced like memories given form, he could pretend that time had stood still, that they were still those young lovers who had once spent hours debating literature and philosophy in these very stacks, before life had taught them that knowledge and wisdom were rarely the same thing.



      He moved deeper into the library, past ranks of students bent over their work like medieval scribes, each face illuminated by the blue glow of laptop screens that cast an otherworldly pallor across their concentrated features. His Margaret's presence followed, offering commentary that existed somewhere between memory and invention. They passed the desk where they'd first met--she a literature student struggling with historical context, he already falling into the habits of pedagogy that would later serve him in other, darker professions.




      At the checkout desk, the weight of his chosen books pressed against his arms like accumulated secrets. His Margaret's voice teased him about his selections. "Only three? You're slipping, Henry. I thought you liked to hoard them."




      "I'm being realistic," he murmured, soft enough that the librarian wouldn't hear. "I've got enough at home I haven't finished yet." Enough unread volumes, enough unfinished conversations, enough incomplete understandings of the woman who waited in their house, slowly disappearing into the fog of forgetting.





      Emma, the librarian whose name he'd learned through months of these visits, smiled with professional warmth as she processed his selections. Her fingers moved across the keyboard with the precise efficiency of someone who had learned to navigate between the world of physical books and digital records, a skill Henry had never quite mastered. "Another productive visit, Dr. Millbank?"




      "Something like that," he replied, sliding the books into his worn leather satchel, feeling their weight settle against his hip like old responsibilities, like memories of briefings and debriefings, of documents that changed lives and ended careers.




      The afternoon light had grown thin and watchful as he emerged from the library, casting long shadows across the paths where students hurried between lectures, their scarves trailing behind them like banners of youth and possibility. His mind's Margaret fell into step beside him as they made their way down West Road, past the law faculty where students sprawled on the grass, their books and laptops creating informal territories on the lawn, each group a small embassy of shared ambition.







      They turned onto Queens' Road, where the Backs stretched away to their left, the Cam moving slow and dark between its manicured banks. The river held its secrets below the surface, much like the city itself, its apparent tranquility masking currents that could pull the unwary under. Punts clustered at the moorings, their summer popularity waning with the season. A few hardy tourists still drifted past, the guides' practiced patter floating across the water: "And to your left, you'll see the Mathematical Bridge..." Their voices carried the same careful blend of truth and embellishment that Henry had once employed in other contexts, for other audiences.




      In his thoughts, Margaret paused, turning her face toward the sky. "It's beautiful, isn't it? Look at the way the light catches King's Chapel."




      Henry glanced up to where the chapel's spires caught the late afternoon sun, its Gothic tracery thrown into sharp relief against the deepening blue of the autumn sky. The stonework seemed to hover between earth and heaven, much like his own existence lately, caught between the woman he'd



married and the one he carried in his mind. "It's Cambridge," he thought. "It always looks like this."




      "Not always." His Margaret smiled, and he could picture perfectly the way the corners of her eyes would crinkle, a detail preserved with the precision of a man who had been trained to notice everything, remember everything. "I remember rain so thick you could barely see the chapel from here. You complained the whole way back to your room in Bodley's Court."




"I don't recall that."





      "Convenient," she teased, her presence warm in his mind as they turned onto Silver Street, where the evening was already gathering in the shadows between buildings.




      They passed the Anchor pub, its windows beginning to glow with early evening warmth, the smell of hops and history drifting from the open door like perfume from a former lover. Students gathered there, their laughter



spilling out onto the street with the careless abundance of youth. Henry felt a sudden, sharp pang of nostalgia for evenings long past, when he and the real Margaret had sat by those windows, planning futures that had turned out both better and worse than they'd imagined. Before he'd learned to lie for a living, before she'd begun to lose the thread of her own story.




      "Do you ever miss it?" his Margaret asked suddenly in his thoughts, her voice carrying that penetrating insight that had always seen through his carefully constructed facades.




      "Miss what?" he replied silently, though he knew what she meant. They'd played this game of questions and evasions throughout their marriage, even before his work had made it necessary.




"Being here. Living here. Being part of it all."





He hesitated, watching a pair of swans glide beneath



the Silver Street bridge, their white forms like ghosts on the darkening water. "Sometimes," he admitted to himself. "But it's different now. Everything's... quieter."




      His Margaret's presence grew thoughtful, her silence as eloquent as any words. "It's not Cambridge that's quieter, Henry."




      They turned onto Sidgwick Avenue, leaving the tourists and students behind. Here, the residential streets took on that particularly English quality of studied anonymity, each house maintaining its privacy behind neat hedges and carefully tended gardens, like agents maintaining their cover stories. Through the window of their terrace house, he could see movement--the real Margaret, probably wandering between rooms, following paths only she could see, each step taking her further from the woman she had been.




      His Margaret, the one who had walked with him from the library, began to fade as they approached the door. She always did at this moment, when reality could no longer be held at bay by memory or wish. Henry paused, key in hand, feeling the weight of books in his satchel and the



accumulated years in his heart.





      Inside, the real Margaret sat in her usual chair by the window, a book open but unread in her lap, its pages as blank to her now as the faces of strangers. She looked up as he entered, her eyes focusing slowly, like a camera adjusting to new light, like an operative trying to place a half-remembered contact. Today her hair was slightly mussed on one side, suggesting she'd been dozing in the chair-- something she never would have allowed in her teaching days, when she'd worn her authority like armor.




      "Henry?" There was a question in her voice, as if she were checking to make sure, as if his name were a password she needed to verify.




      "Yes, love." He set his satchel down carefully by the hall table, its leather worn smooth by years of similar gestures, similar homecomings. "I've brought some new books from the library."



      She nodded, though he wasn't sure if she'd fully understood. Today seemed to be one of her distant days, when the present felt like a dream she couldn't quite grasp, when the world around her seemed as insubstantial as the lies he'd once told for queen and country. He moved to the kitchen, filling the kettle with practiced motions, listening to the familiar sounds of their house settling around him: the slight creak of Margaret's chair, the tick of the clock they'd bought in Prague thirty years ago (during an operation he'd never told her about), the distant rumble of traffic on Grange Road.




      His Margaret materialized by the counter, clear in his mind as a surveillance photograph. "Earl Grey?" she asked with gentle reproach. "You know she prefers English Breakfast in the afternoon."




      Henry paused, hand hovering over the tea tin. She was right, of course. The real Margaret had always been particular about her tea, a habit formed during her years teaching sixth form English at the Perse School, where she'd maintained standards as rigid as any intelligence service.
He selected a different tin, measuring the leaves with care into the brown Betty teapot that had survived three decades



of daily use, its brown glaze holding the patina of countless afternoons like this one.




      While the tea steeped, he arranged Margaret's favorite biscuits--plain digestives, nothing fancy--on a blue willow plate. Through the kitchen window, he could see their small garden, where late roses still bloomed against the brick wall, their petals holding the day's last light like secrets. Margaret had always been proud of those roses, nursing them through drought and frost with the same steady determination she'd once applied to her students' essays.
Now they grew wild and slightly unkempt, like memories allowed to wander untended.




      He carried the tea tray into the sitting room, setting it carefully on the low table between their chairs. The real Margaret stirred, her face brightening slightly at the familiar ritual, muscle memory outlasting conscious thought.




      "Oh," she said, surprise touching her features. "You're home early."





      "Right on time, actually." He poured her tea, adding milk in the precise proportion she'd always preferred, a detail preserved with the same care he'd once given to operational protocols. "Would you like me to read for a while?"




      She picked up her cup, inhaling its steam. For a moment, clarity sparked in her eyes like sunlight on water. "You always bring the most serious books," she said, and he caught a glimpse of the woman who had taught literature for thirty years, who had made Shakespeare come alive for generations of students at the Perse. "All those histories and biographies. As if the world isn't complicated enough already."




      His Margaret, perched in his mind's eye on the arm of his chair, seemed to reach out toward her older self, the gesture carrying all the tenderness of their shared years together, all the weight of what had been lost and what remained.



      "Read then," the real Margaret said, turning back to the window where the October evening was painting the sky in watercolor shades of pink and gold. "Before the light goes."




      Henry opened one of his newly borrowed books, its pages crackling with promise like coded messages waiting to be deciphered. Outside, bicycles whirred past on their way to evening lectures or supervision meetings, and somewhere in the distance, a chapel bell began to toll, marking time's passage with bronze certainty. Here in their sitting room, time moved differently, measured not in minutes but in sips of tea and turned pages, in the steady rhythm of his voice as he read to both versions of his wife.




      Later, after he'd helped the real Margaret to bed--a process that grew more complex with each passing month, like an operation slowly unraveling--Henry returned to his chair. His Margaret waited in his thoughts, watching him with the knowing look she'd perfected over decades of marriage, the look that had seen through every cover story he'd ever tried to maintain at home.




"You're restless tonight," she observed.







      "Am I?" He picked up his empty teacup, studying the leaves at the bottom as if they might hold answers to questions he hadn't yet formed, patterns he couldn't quite decipher.




      "You have that look. The one you used to get when something was brewing at work."




      Henry set the cup down carefully. "I'm retired. Nothing brews anymore except tea."




      "Liar," she said fondly in his mind. "You're like one of those old racehorses that still prick up their ears at the starting bell. Always waiting for the next race, the next mission, the next chance to prove you haven't lost your edge."




      Through the window, he could see lights coming on in houses along their street, each window framing its own small



drama of evening routines, each lit square a dossier of ordinary lives. A student hurried past, her scarf trailing behind her like a banner of youth's certainties. In the distance, the floodlights around King's Chapel had switched on, turning the magnificent building into a floating castle of light against the darkening sky, a beacon of permanence in a world of shifting shadows.




      "Get some sleep," his Margaret whispered in his thoughts. "Tomorrow's another day."




      He nodded, though they both knew sleep would be long in coming. Upstairs, the real Margaret murmured in her dreams, while outside, the old city settled into its nightly rhythms of students and scholars, each pursuing their own versions of truth, each building their own narratives from the raw material of experience.




      Henry remained in his chair, surrounded by books and memories, feeling the familiar weight of watchfulness settle over him like an old coat, like the habits of observation and analysis he'd never quite managed to shed. His Margaret was right--something was stirring in the shadows of his



carefully constructed retirement. He could sense it, even if he couldn't yet name it, the way he'd once sensed operations about to go wrong, assets about to turn, certainties about to crumble.
