# Chapter 4

The morning light filtered through the kitchen windows of Henry Millbank's Cambridge home with an accusatory brightness that made him wince. Margaret stood at the counter, her movements uncertain as she attempted to prepare tea – a ritual she had performed thousands of times over their decades together. The kettle whistled, but she stared at it as if it were speaking an alien language.




"Darling," Henry said softly, "shall I help with that?"





      Margaret turned, her face a mask of momentary confusion. "Oh, Henry. Yes, perhaps... I seem to have forgotten..." Her voice trailed off as she reached for a cup, missing it entirely. The delicate porcelain crashed to



the floor, fragmenting into a constellation of white shards.





      When she bent to clean up the mess, her balance failed her. Henry lunged forward, but too late. Margaret's head struck the corner of the kitchen counter as she fell. The sound of impact would haunt him for months to come – a dull thud that seemed to echo through their quiet home like a gunshot.




      Blood began to pool beneath her silver hair, and Henry's hands trembled as he reached for his phone. The numbers swam before his eyes as he dialed emergency services, his other hand pressed against her wound. In that moment, all thoughts of Operation Glasshouse, of Elena, of decades-old secrets evaporated like morning mist. There was only Margaret, still and pale on their kitchen floor, and the terrible weight of time pressing down on them both.
      Tom Bell sat at his desk in the Guardian newsroom, staring at his mobile phone as if it might detonate. His father's name glowed on the screen, a rare enough occurrence to signal trouble. When he finally answered, the old man's voice carried none of its usual careful restraint.



      "Your mother's had a fall. She's being taken to Addenbrooke's."




      The words hung in the air between them, heavy with unspoken accusations. Tom closed his eyes, remembering the last time he'd visited – Christmas, wasn't it? Or was it longer?




      "I'll be there as soon as I can," he said, already reaching for his coat. His editor looked up questioningly, but Tom merely shook his head as he hurried past. On the train to Cambridge, he tried to focus on the trade negotiation documents on his laptop, but his mind kept drifting to childhood memories of his mother's laugh, her gentle hands, her increasingly vacant eyes in recent years.




      The fluorescent lights of Addenbrooke's Hospital cast everyone in a sickly pallor, making it difficult for Henry to distinguish between actual surveillance and paranoid imagination. A nurse moved past Margaret's room for the third time in ten minutes – routine rounds or something more sinister? Tom sat in the corner, radiating quiet hostility, his attention divided between his phone and occasional



glances at his unconscious mother.





      "The CT scan results should be back soon," Henry said, more to break the silence than to inform.




      Tom grunted in response, then looked up sharply as a man in a dark suit walked past the door, pausing just long enough to glance inside. Henry recognized the telltale signs of MI6 tradecraft – the calculated casualness, the too- perfect posture. They were watching, even here.
      While Henry spoke with a doctor in the corridor, Tom took the opportunity to examine his father's briefcase, left carelessly by the chair. His journalistic instincts, honed by years of investigating government corruption, tingled at the sight of a manila envelope partially protruding from its leather confines.




      The documents inside bore classification stamps that made his pulse quicken. Operation Glasshouse – the name appeared repeatedly, along with references to economic destabilization programs and a figure codenamed Orpheus. Tom photographed several pages with his phone before carefully



returning everything to its original position, his conscience warring with professional curiosity.




      "The fall caused a subdural hematoma," the neurologist explained, her voice carefully measured. "We've managed to reduce the swelling, but given Mrs. Millbank's age and her pre-existing cognitive decline..."




      Henry nodded mechanically, but his attention had been caught by a familiar figure at the end of the corridor.
Elena stood near the nurses' station, ostensibly reading a chart. Their eyes met briefly, and he saw something that might have been genuine sympathy in her expression before she turned away.




      The hospital café served coffee that tasted of burnt dreams and stale regret. Henry and Tom sat across from each other, neither touching their cups. The distance between them seemed both vast and microscopic – thirty years of misunderstandings compressed into three feet of formica tabletop.





      "She asked about you last week," Henry said finally. "Couldn't remember if you were still in university or working in London."




      Tom's fingers tightened around his cup. "I should have visited more."




      "Yes," Henry agreed, too tired for gentler lies. "You should have."
      The night shift brought a different quality of silence to the hospital ward. Henry sat in the uncomfortable chair beside Margaret's bed, watching the steady rise and fall of her chest. The machines beeped their mechanical lullaby while he considered his options. The Operation Glasshouse investigation couldn't wait – not with Elena's presence confirming that multiple agencies were closing in – but leaving Margaret felt like a betrayal of everything they'd built together.




      Unknown to Henry, Tom observed this vigil from the doorway, noting how his father's hand repeatedly strayed to



the briefcase at his feet, as if checking that its secrets remained secure.
      In the quiet hours before dawn, Tom used the hospital's wifi to cross-reference the information he'd photographed.
His laptop screen illuminated his face as connections emerged between the decades-old operation and current international trade negotiations. His father's name appeared in documents from both eras, raising questions that family loyalty couldn't easily dismiss.
      The first rays of morning sun painted Cambridge's spires in gold, visible from Margaret's hospital window. Henry stood watching the city wake, his decision crystallizing with the growing light. He would continue his investigation – not despite Margaret's condition, but because of it. The truth of Operation Glasshouse might be the last gift he could offer her, a final act of redemption for all the secrets he'd kept.




      Behind him, Tom pretended to sleep in his chair, his own investigation already taking shape in his mind. Father and son, each pursuing the same truth from opposite directions, bound together by the unconscious woman who lay between them – a living bridge across their years of silence.
