# Chapter 0

Snow fell in wet clumps over Prague, transforming the carefully mapped escape routes into a maze of white uncertainty. Henry Millbank stood at the frost-etched window of the safe house, a third-floor walk-up in Malá Strana where the wallpaper peeled like dead skin from ancient wounds. His breath clouded the glass as he checked his watch again: 2245 hours. Fifteen minutes until either triumph or catastrophe.


      Henry spread the operational plans across the safe house's scarred desk one final time, his fingers tracing the route he'd memorized weeks ago in Cartwright's oak-paneled office. The fountain pen annotations were still crisp in the margins: "2300 - Primary arrives with WINTER. Vehicle transfer at Point Echo. K & B standing by with papers + modified vehicle." Simple arrows marked their passage west -



narrow roads through dense forest, each checkpoint and camera noted, each potential choke point accounted for. Six hours to the border, assuming perfect execution.


      He'd run similar extractions a dozen times, back in Berlin. The methodology was sound, each step built on proven tradecraft. Yet something in the plan's very precision made his shoulder blades itch. Like a stage set that looked perfect until you noticed the paint was still wet.


      His watch showed 2242. Eighteen minutes until Orpheus's arrival. Through the window, snow transformed the carefully plotted escape route into an alien landscape. Henry folded the plans with mechanical precision, each crease as sharp as the line between success and failure. The paper whispered between his fingers like autumn leaves anticipating winter.


      Behind him, the radio crackled with Keller's check-in from the garage. Old Jim, who'd talked his way through East German checkpoints with nothing but nerve and perfect papers. Now waiting in a cold garage with Sarah Blackwood, that bright Oxford girl who'd learned to wear danger like a second skin. Both of them believing in the clean simplicity of the plan laid out in distant London.



      Henry tucked the folded papers into his jacket pocket, feeling their weight settle next to his service weapon. The snow kept falling, erasing certainty with each white flake.


      "Echo One in position." Keller's voice crackled through the encrypted line with the steady assurance that had made him legendary in Berlin. The kind of man who could walk through checkpoints on nerve alone, carrying death in his briefcase and paradise in his papers.


      "Acknowledged." Henry's eyes tracked a black Volvo moving too slowly for the weather, its wipers keeping metronome time with his pulse. The Volvo's driver sat too straight, shoulders squared with military rigidity despite his civilian coat. His hands gripped the wheel at precisely ten and two, never shifting position even as the car crawled through the snow. Only his head moved, mechanical sweeps left to right every twelve seconds, like a metronome keeping time with protocol rather than traffic. The wipers tracked back and forth across his windscreen, but the driver's eyes never followed their motion - instead they fixed on predetermined points, scanning the street with the practiced economy of a man marking grid coordinates on a surveillance map. A cigarette burned untouched in his ashtray, smoke rising in an unnatural column that no casual driver would ignore.





      Henry's hand drifted unconsciously toward his holster as the Volvo made another pass, its pace too measured for the treacherous conditions. Through the swirling snow, he caught the driver's profile - blank as a mannequin's, yet somehow radiating the focused alertness of a predator marking its territory.


      "Echo Two, ready." Blackwood's words cut through the static, each syllable clipped with the same precision she'd once used to diagram Old English verbs at Oxford. Six months ago, she would have added a casual "all set" or "standing by." But field work had stripped such flourishes from her voice, leaving only the essentials - like a professor's syntax honed into a knife's edge. Through the encrypted line, Henry heard the soft click of her safety being checked, a sound as familiar to her now as the rustle of academic papers had been in another life. She would be positioned exactly three meters from the garage's north entrance, Browning at her hip, diplomatic papers folded in her breast pocket with the same meticulous care she'd once given to her doctoral thesis. Already she had learned the field operative's catechism: preparation was the only prayer that got answered.


Henry turned from the window, surveying their cover



once more. Books and papers scattered across a worn desk - the careful disorder of an academic researching Czech architectural history. All of it precisely wrong, like a stage set arranged by someone who had only read about scholars in files. The room held its breath around him, waiting for the next move in this elaborate game of make- believe.
      The second Volvo appeared at 2257, ghosting through the snow like a mirror image of the first. Both cars drifted past the safe house at precisely the same speed, their wipers marking identical arcs through the gathering white. A chess game played with three-ton pieces.


      Henry pressed the radio transmit button. "Echo One, possible compromise." The earpiece hissed static. He tried again, tasting copper as he bit the inside of his cheek.
Nothing. The silence stretched for three endless minutes - enough time for WINTER's men to blanket the area in electronic darkness.


      At 2305, headlights cut through the snow. Right on schedule, as if reading from a script. WINTER sat behind the wheel of Orpheus's car, his face blank as fresh paper. The KGB defector emerged into the swirling white, and in the moment before the shooting started, his eyes met Henry's through the window. A lifetime of survival distilled into a



single glance.



      The first shot punched through the glass beside Henry's head. Others followed in a precise sequence - one-two-three
- forces moving into pre-arranged positions like actors hitting their marks. WINTER was already gone, melted into the darkness between muzzle flashes. From the garage came the sharp bark of Keller's pistol, then Blackwood's, then nothing.


      Snowflakes settled on Orpheus's shoulders as he stood in the orange cone of a streetlight. His polished accent carried over the muffled sounds of gunfire from the garage. "The winter markets, Mr. Millbank. Third stall from the bridge. When the river ice breaks." He lifted his collar against the snow, stepped into darkness, and vanished between one heartbeat and the next.


      Henry pressed himself against ancient stonework, feeling centuries of grime against his cheek. Left on Josefská, right into the shadow of St. Nicholas Church, down worn steps slick with fresh powder. Each turn erased by falling snow. Past shuttered shops where mannequins stood witness behind frosted glass. Through courtyards where his footprints disappeared almost as quickly as he made them.





      The eastern sky had begun to lighten, painting the castle's silhouette against purple-grey clouds. Somewhere behind him, smoke rose from a burning car that would soon become part of the official record. In London, Cartwright would be arriving at his desk in exactly two hours, Fortnum's tea cooling beside morning signals from Prague, each carefully edited cable adding another brushstroke to tomorrow's history.
