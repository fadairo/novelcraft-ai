# Chapter 3

Dawn arrived in Cambridge like an uncertain witness, its grey light seeping through morning fog that clung to the Backs like old regrets. Henry stood at his study window, watching a lone rower cut through the mist on the Cam, the oars breaking the water's surface with mechanical precision. He'd been awake for hours, sleep having proved as elusive as the meanings hidden in the note that now lay in his desk drawer beneath Larkin's collected works.




      The house still held its nighttime silence, broken only by the soft whisper of the heating system and Margaret's steady breathing from upstairs. These early hours had always been his refuge, a space between worlds where he could let his guard down, allow the carefully maintained walls between past and present to blur. His Margaret materialized beside



him, her presence as familiar as his own reflection in the window glass.




      "You've already made up your mind," she said, not a question but a statement of fact. She'd always been able to read him, even when he thought himself unreadable.




      "Have I?" He watched the rower disappear into the fog, leaving barely a ripple to mark their passage. The river's surface smoothed itself like memory, like history being rewritten.




      Last night's rain had left the gardens slick with moisture, each leaf and blade of grass holding its own small mirror to the sky. The world seemed wrapped in cotton wool, muffled and distant, yet somehow more immediate, more threatening for its very softness. Henry felt the weight of observation pressing against him, as if the fog itself held eyes.




The telephone on his desk remained silent, but its very



silence seemed pregnant with possibility. The email he'd sent last night--carefully coded references embedded in a scholarly query about Eastern European diplomatic
protocols--would have reached its recipient by now. Whether it would receive a response, and what form that response might take, remained to be seen.




      He moved to his desk, withdrawing Winters' memoir from his briefcase. In the morning light, its garish dust jacket seemed almost offensive, too bright against the subtle greys and browns of his study. He opened it to where he'd left off, but the words swam before his eyes, refusing to resolve into meaning.




      A door opened upstairs--Margaret beginning her morning routine. Henry listened to her movements, cataloging each sound against his mental inventory of her good days and bad. The steps seemed steady enough, purposeful rather than uncertain. A good day, then, or at least the promise of one.




      His Margaret watched him from her perch on the desk's edge. "You're already doing it," she observed. "Calculating variables, assessing risks. The academic's gone, and the



operative's back."





      "They were never really separate," Henry murmured, though whether to her or himself, he wasn't sure.




      The sound of running water filtered down from above, accompanied by the ancient pipes' protestations. Henry moved to the kitchen, beginning the ritual of breakfast preparation that had become his anchor in retirement. Tea first--English Breakfast, steeped exactly four minutes in the brown Betty teapot. Toast, cut diagonally. The routine of it steadied him, gave him space to think.




      The post arrived with a soft thud of letters against doormat. Henry retrieved them mechanically, sorting bills from circulars from the occasional academic correspondence. But among the ordinary mail lay a postcard from Prague, its image showing the Charles Bridge at sunset. No message, no signature, just a series of numbers written in a cramped hand along the bottom edge: 23.47.19.85.



      Henry studied the postcard with the careful attention he'd once given to surveillance photographs, each detail cataloged and filed away for future reference. The numbers nagged at his consciousness like a half-remembered melody. A date, perhaps? Or coordinates? The possibilities multiplied like ripples in still water.




      Margaret's footsteps on the stairs interrupted his analysis. He slipped the postcard into his pocket alongside the note, an action so smooth it might have been unconscious. But nothing about Henry's movements had been truly unconscious for decades.




      "You're up early," Margaret said as she entered the kitchen, her voice carrying that particular clarity that marked her better days. She wore her blue dressing gown, the one she'd had since their early years of marriage, its fabric worn soft with time and washing.




      "Couldn't sleep," Henry replied, pouring her tea with practiced precision. "The rain kept me awake."





      "It wasn't raining," she said, that sharp intelligence flickering in her eyes like summer lightning. "Not since midnight. I heard you pacing."




      Henry felt the familiar tightening in his chest--the tension between truth and protection, between the man he was and the husband he tried to be. "Just restless thoughts," he offered, setting her toast before her with careful attention to its alignment on the plate. "Academic matters."




      Margaret's laugh held a touch of her old warmth. "Academic matters don't make you pace, Henry. Not like this." She took a sip of tea, her hands steady today. "You're worried about something."




      In his mind, his Margaret perched on the kitchen counter, watching this exchange with knowing eyes. The real Margaret buttered her toast with precise movements, each stroke measured and deliberate, while his Margaret smiled that half-smile that had always seen through his carefully constructed facades.







      "The Winters book," he said finally, offering a portion of truth like a peace offering. "It's brought back some memories."




      "Prague," Margaret said, and for a moment Henry's heart stopped. But she was simply remembering their tourist visit in the nineties, not the other Prague, his Prague, with its shadows and secrets and the weight of operations gone wrong. "We should go back someday. When I'm... when things are better."




      The morning light filtered through the kitchen window, casting parallel bars of brightness across the table between them. Outside, Cambridge was coming awake--the distant sound of traffic growing steadily, the first students beginning their migration toward lecture halls, the world resuming its ordinary rhythms. But beneath these surface patterns, Henry felt deeper currents moving, invisible but powerful, like the undertow beneath a calm sea.



      He spent the morning in his study, ostensibly grading papers but actually dissecting Winters' memoir with forensic precision. The book's account of Prague in the mid-eighties diverged subtly from his memories--dates that didn't quite align, meetings described from angles that felt wrong, like photographs taken from impossible positions. And throughout the text, strange emphases, odd choices of words that tickled the edges of his awareness like the first hints of a coded message.




      The postcard's numbers had begun to resolve themselves in his mind. Not a date--the patterns were wrong for that. Not coordinates--too many digits, wrongly grouped. But when he overlaid them onto the book's pagination... There. Pages 23, 47, 19, 85. Each one containing a paragraph that seemed innocuous in isolation but, when read in sequence, painted a very different picture of events than the one in the official record.




      The telephone rang at precisely eleven. Henry let it sound twice before answering, his voice carefully modulated to project academic distraction. "Yes?"



      "Professor Millbank?" A young man's voice, unfamiliar yet carrying undertones that made Henry's neck muscles tighten. "I'm calling from the Faculty of History. There's been a request for your old course materials on European diplomatic relations, particularly anything covering Prague during the Cold War."




      "I'm afraid there's been a mistake," Henry replied, falling into the familiar rhythms of deflection. "My specialty was pre-war diplomacy. Perhaps you're thinking of Professor Lambert?"




"No mistake," the voice said, and hung up.





      Henry sat very still, listening to the empty line's soft hiss. In his mind, his Margaret materialized by the window, her expression grave. "It's starting, isn't it?" she asked. "The machinery's in motion."




      "Yes," he said, both to her and to himself. "I suppose it is."







      He spent the afternoon maintaining his cover--reviewing student essays, preparing lecture notes, playing the role of the retired academic with the same attention to detail he'd once given to more clandestine performances. But beneath this careful facade, his mind worked on the puzzle presented by the book, the note, the postcard, the call. Each piece suggesting a pattern he could almost grasp, like a word on the tip of his tongue.




      The telephone rang again at half past three. This time, Henry recognized the voice immediately.




      "You're getting careless in your retirement," David Cartwright said, his public school accent unchanged by the decades since they'd last spoken. "Sending emails with old recognition signals? I thought I taught you better than that."




      Henry felt his chest tighten, muscle memory responding to the voice of his former handler before his conscious mind



could intervene. "David," he said carefully, testing the name like thin ice. "This is unexpected."




      "Is it?" Cartwright's tone carried a weight that Henry remembered all too well--the subtle emphasis that transformed simple questions into loaded weapons. "I rather think you've been expecting this call since you found that note."




      The afternoon light seemed to thicken in Henry's study, dust motes hanging suspended like moments between heartbeats. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said, the lie falling from his lips with practiced ease.




      "Stay away from Glasshouse, Henry." Cartwright's voice had lost its casual edge. "Some ghosts are too dangerous to resurrect. For everyone's sake, let the past stay buried."




      "The past," Henry said, choosing his words with careful precision, "seems unwilling to extend me the same courtesy."





      A long silence followed, broken only by the soft static of the line. When Cartwright spoke again, his voice carried a gentleness that was somehow more threatening than any overt warning. "You have a good life now. A wife who needs you. Don't throw that away chasing old shadows."




      The line went dead before Henry could respond. He sat very still, listening to the empty frequency's soft hiss, feeling the weight of implications settle around him like falling snow. In his mind, his Margaret watched him with concern, but he couldn't meet even her imagined gaze.




      The sound of breaking glass from upstairs shattered his reverie. Henry found Margaret in their bedroom, surrounded by the remains of a water glass, her expression confused and frustrated in equal measure. "I can't seem to," she began, then stopped, looking at him with sudden clarity. "Something's wrong, isn't it? Not with me--with you."




      Henry knelt carefully, gathering the larger shards of glass. "What makes you say that?"







      "You have that look," she said, her voice carrying an echo of her former acuity. "The one you used to get, back when... back before." She frowned, struggling to hold onto the thought. "When something mattered. Really mattered."




      He stood slowly, the broken glass cupped carefully in his palm. "Margaret--"




      "Don't protect me, Henry," she interrupted, that familiar steel threading through her voice. "Not from this. Whatever it is, you need to do it. I can see that much."




      The late afternoon sun slanted through their bedroom window, painting Margaret's silver hair with threads of gold. For a moment, she was both versions of herself at
once--the sharp-minded woman who had seen through his covers for decades, and the increasingly fragile person she was becoming. Henry felt the weight of choices pressing against him like atmospheric pressure before a storm.





      "I'll fetch the dustpan," he said finally, unable to find words for the truth that lay between them like broken glass.




      Evening settled over Cambridge like a heavy velvet curtain, drawing shadows long across the quadrangles and courts. Henry sat in his study, Winters' memoir open before him, and began to write his own account of those days in Prague--not the sanitized version that existed in official reports, but the truth as he had lived it. Each word felt like a step across a line he'd drawn years ago, a boundary between then and now that was becoming increasingly permeable.




      The night air carried the first hint of frost, winter approaching like a spy--subtle but inevitable. Somewhere in the darkness, wheels had been set in motion that threatened everything he'd built since leaving the service. But Margaret's words echoed in his mind, carrying their own weight of truth: Whatever it is, you need to do it.



      He wrote until the words blurred before his eyes, each page an attempt to map the territory between loyalty and betrayal, between duty and self-preservation. The truth was in there somewhere, hidden like a coded message in plain text, waiting for the right key to unlock its meaning.
