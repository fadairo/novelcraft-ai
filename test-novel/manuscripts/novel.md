# Chapter 1

_London, England_

He hoped that the camera would frame a stoic portrait -- prudence, justice, fortitude, temperance -- but an inflection of his mouth revealed embarrassment stifled, the blush dulled by salt-flecked stubble.

"Yuri Lenkov has been described as the good oligarch. With a fortune estimated at some eight billion pounds, he has gone to great lengths to set himself apart from the others."

Yuri looked past the anchor's blonde curls and watched Yulia pace behind the cameras that appeared to move without operators, her arms folded, flitting in and out of view, spectacles glinting on her shadowed face. She seemed rattled - standing still, she shifted from foot to foot.

"Mr Lenkov, a former KGB officer working for almost a decade out of the Soviet embassy here in London, has devoted his cash to hopeful ventures; bankrolling loss-making enterprises in both Russia and Britain, and for years, his _Otkraveniya Gazeta_ has been a thorn in the side of corrupt bureaucrats and politicians. His journalists regularly receiving death threats."

Yuri lifted his head and stroked his jaw with the back of his left hand, a comforting bristle.

"After years of staying out of politics, last month Mr Lenkov entered the mayoral race in his native Moscow leading the Phoenix Party of Change - a party accused of cultivating the ultra-right, promoting Orthodox Christianity and entering into an unholy alliance with the Kremlin."

She turned to him and smiled, tucking an errant lock behind her ear with one hand and clasping the redundant sheet of notes with the other. Yuri shifted on the swivel chair. He crossed his right leg over his left, and steepled his palms, elbows on his knees, crouching forward towards the desk that separated him from the presenter. The camera inspected his manicured nails and tanned hands, a _chotki_ rosary wrapped around his left wrist, twists of copper and brass wrought about his right. His lips parted, then firmed and pursed.

"Mr Lenkov, I would like to begin by asking you -- what changed?"

Yuri stared mid-distance to the right of the presenter and caught a reflection from Yulia's glasses. An in-out. A deep-slow. A calm-ease. A smile-release. The here-now. _O God cleanse me, a sinner_. He returned his focus to the presenter, gazing alternately between her eyes and her breastbone as he had been trained to do, and began to explain.

The entire interview lasted less than six minutes.

# Chapter Two

_Moscow, Russia_

Pushkin laboured to open the door, a plastic shopping bag and keys in one hand, a bottle of _Starka_ in the other. His sneakered foot pushed, wedged, then shut the door, and he shuffled along the hallway to the kitchen. He dropped the keys and the carrier bag on the formica table and poured himself two fingers of the vodka, and into a second tumbler, some tap water. He swallowed two tablets of amoxicillin and two of ketanov. He returned to the hallway to remove his raincoat, maneuvering it into place on the overburdened coat rack, and caught a draught of Katya's scent as a scarf brushed his face. He rummaged in the slim side-pocket of the mackintosh and extracted a bag of toffees.

In the kitchen, he unpacked a loaf of tula bread, slicing a cube for a snack, and picked up the vodka. He levered off his sneakers without untying the laces. Another hole had emerged in his socks, the right foot this time, a misshapen toe flaunting its redness against the grey of the wool. Katya might mend it.

Pushkin prodded his tongue at the salty surrounds of the pegs that had been prepared to replace the broken crown of a rear molar and was rewarded with a stab of pain. The anaesthetic was losing its effect.

In the living room, he placed the vodka and toffees on a side table. He leant over the back of the armchair and dug for the stereo remote control, finding it under the seat cushion, then thumbed the standby button and waited for the opening strains of Frankie Valli's 'The Night', and slid his stockinged feet on the wooden floor - the shuffle, a sidestep and spin. He sat, took a sip and closed his eyes.

He heard the keys drop, but he could not get up. His legs would not unfold, they would not work as his hand flopped useless on the arm of the chair. A key turned in the lock. He was alert now and in darkness.

The apartment door opened. A jangle and scrape as Katya wrestled a key from the lock, and then a firm shut. He heard a rustle and looked to his feet. Betrayed. Three sweet wrappers and an empty glass next to the half finished bottle of vodka. How did that manage to get there? Must be past two.

Light cracked through the doorway as he glanced at his left wrist - eyes refusing to focus on either the big or little hands against the phosphorescent markings on his watch.

"What are you doing here?" she asked, placing her clutch bag on the vintage Arne Vodder sideboard that had been an ambitious and futile _settling down_ gift from his parents. The lights snapped on.

Pushkin managed a grimace and pointed to his mouth.

"Not again! And no doubt a fat bill from your friendly dentist," she sighed. He waited for the sympathies to caress him, but she had spotted the bag of sweets nestled by his thigh.

"My God! You are not a child Sasha!" She grabbed the bag as Pushkin ducked away from her swoop on the toffees. She turned her head, looking for the bin that she knew was not there. She screamed. Pushkin closed his eyes.

"How long have you been here?" She did not wait for the answer.

Pushkin heard a rattle from the kitchen, a door opening and closing, then returned from the kitchen with Pushkin's phone in her hand.

"All day?" she asked.

Pushkin shook his head. She shook hers.

"Look! Missed calls. Three from me! Look!" she said, facing the screen towards him, then lobbing the phone at him.

"And this? -- " turning the television on and flipping through the channels to _Russia Today_. Pushkin read the banner at the bottom of the screen and sat up. He perched on the edge of his seat and rubbed the stupor from his eyes. Katya placed a coaster on the side table, then deposited a glass of sparkling water on it and removed the bottle of vodka, the empty glass, the debris.

The footage showed the outside of a television studio in London. A crowd. Pushkin recognised the emblem of the _stoyaki_, a white phoenix rising on a green background. Placards with the slogan 'Awaken and Arise' - in English and Russian. Some doctored images of the Kremlin in flames, the phoenix soaring above leaving a slipstream of white.

In the centre of it all - Yuri Semyonovich Lenkov.

The close-up was of his groomed head, the scalp shaved -- a dome reflecting the perfect configuration of health, wealth and intellect. His perfect blue eyes sparkled from behind modest metal frames. His stubble an agreeable length - the perfect side of nonchalance. Lenkov wore a charcoal turtleneck sweater. A male assistant draped a navy overcoat around his shoulders. Pushkin took a sip of water, dribbling then spilling slightly on his hand and the table as Katya returned. She had removed her blouse and skirt and stood facing the television screen, barefoot in a vest and knickers.

Flashes as Lenkov waved at the crowd, pointing skyward, the party salute.

The camera panned out and Pushkin noticed the classic cross pattern for close protection, a car ahead -- the security advance party, with its brake lights lit; ear-pieced, suited, shaven-headed barriers dotted the convoy of black steel and smoked mirrors. The door of the second car -- an S-Class Mercedes -- opened for Lenkov. He dipped his head and entered, then withdrew and used the sill guard to stand and elevate his position by a foot, again pointing skyward, his overcoat slipping off, a 'bullet catcher' rescuing it. Lenkov pointed to the sky and shouted their slogan -- 'Awaken and Arise'. Perfect teeth.

An SUV came to a halt behind Lenkov's sedan. Doors opened and slammed shut as the personal escort section prepared for the exit.

The camera panned back to a wide shot for the glorious departure as white smoke plumed from exhausts as the convoy set off.

Pushkin took a sip from the tumbler and poked at the gap where his wisdom tooth had been.

The blast burned the camera retina and it took some time for it to refocus on the devastation. Now the sound. Camera directions and further explosions. The reversing SUV. Doors opening and the black clad protection officers rushing forward. Hands to head. Palms shielding faces. The advance car had been blown into the middle of the main road.

Lenkov's car had disintegrated.

Pushkin put a hand to his face and mouthed a painful 'fuck'. Katya turned. She would leave him to it.

And for a brief moment, Lenkov was resurrected as the footage rewound to the cars drawing away from the television studio, and then in slow motion, the lights changing and the lead car racing ahead, the flash and then the distorted slow-mo sounds; the camera shake, refocus, and shouting.

Back to the studio.

"It has been confirmed that along with Yuri Lenkov, the car's driver and a member of his security personnel were killed. There are no further details from the UK authorities."

Pushkin muted the television and looked at his phone, the digits on the home screen indicating 02:47. The first call was from Dmitri at 21:43 - three minutes after the assassination. He swiped to return the call, then paused. He put the phone down, shifted back in his seat, unmuted the television and read the subtitles as Yuri Lenkov gave his final interview.

Twice the teeth woke him, but he struggled back to sleep with the aid of more tablets. Katya had not been in the mood when he woke for a third time -- she had rolled away and slapped his stomach. A draft iced his feet before he had the chance to pull on his socks. He tuned to the rain-beat that had persisted through the night and smiled at her snoring, a snuffle of sorts.

At the kitchen sink, he gargled with salt water. An apple juice chaser. No brushing this morning. For once, the boiler was working. He rinsed his face with warm water, using a discarded dish cloth to pat it dry.

In the bedroom, he noticed that Katya had rolled over again. From the chest of drawers, Pushkin selected grey slacks, a _Horses_ sweatshirt - home colours, and a _tikkuri_ from that trip to Hailuto Island. He pulled out an olive pair of socks from the top drawer that housed a row of similar socks that needed remedial attention - all darned, repaired. He turned to the snuffle and smiled again. Hair cobwebbed over her profile in dark strands. Whatever did she see in him?

He placed a knee on the bed and supported himself with one hand on the chilled pillow. He dropped a kiss on her cheek and was greeted with a groan.

"Take an umbrella," she muffled into the sheets.

A storm broke as Pushkin lumbered up the stairs exiting the station at Yuzhnyy. At the top of the steps, he lifted his head to take in the car fumes. He closed his eyes, as much to lessen his headache as to fully absorb the day, ignoring the commuters brushing passed him in their hurry to get to offices on Petrovaskaya.

The rain began to fall so heavily and in such determined drops that he decided against running like the other commuters, and instead walked steadily to Nikolskaya Plaza, by which time the rain had surpassed the expectations of the raincoat's manufacturer and the bottom half of his trousers clung to his legs. He carried his study satchel in one hand, and in the other he grasped the remnants of the tula bread wrapped in tissue paper. His sneakers leaked and made a squishing sound as he stepped out of the puddles he had stepped into. He crossed the junctions, beating the lights and the impatient tram drivers with timed precision.

As he turned along the square a flash of lightning lit up the long, straight line of concrete-faced government buildings from the Federal State Service to the Presidential Offices on Staraya. It illuminated the street for a second, then plunged the sky into greyness, a mighty clap of thunder shaking Pushkin from thoughts of Katya in bed.

Papa Radu was at the kiosk on Ilyinka as usual. A waterproof cape, that also served on occasion as a groundsheet, cascaded about him and rivulets formed puddles by his feet. On his head he wore a _beskozirka_ -- a sailor's hat, the old man proud to display the orange and black tallies of the Soviet Navy guard. The flat crown delivered gobs of rain straight to his face, as the redundant hood spilled its contents behind.

"You should get a proper coat and some galoshes," he said, pointing at Pushkin's feet. Pushkin felt no pity for the old newspaper seller; he knew what the old man had once done at the Lubyanka. Papa Radu rearranged some of the magazines under the plastic that was protecting the journals from the rain and handed over a copy of _Noviya Gazeta_. The headline read - 'To Ashes'. Pushkin noticed that the cover of _Otkraveniya_ bore no headline, just a full page portrait of Yuri Lenkov with tombstone text.

"Aren't you freezing in that tent?" he asked. Papa Radu did not answer, but blew on his nicotine stubbed fingers, crinkled wet in the downpour, then took the crisp one rouble note from the proffered hand that still held the remnants of Pushkin's breakfast. Selling papers was taking its toll. In the shelter of the kiosk steam rose from his shoulders, and Pushkin noted the cloud of wet-dog body-fug that had formed about the man as he waited for his morning customers.

"Have you heard anything?"

"Well, of course. There's only one feature today."

"And?"

"You may want to speak with your chums down the road, though it seems a bit lively, even for them." The old man chuckled, warming his hands and stamping his boots, then stopping as he realised that he was splashing a favoured client. "Only one type bring bombs to a barbecue."

"Chechens then?" Pushkin tested, and was rewarded with a glimpse of gold amongst the brown rot of the man's teeth.

"Georgian for God's sake! Try the boys from Tbilisi." And then the old man spat, lowered his head and wiped rain away from the front of his covering. "All a pretty mess," he continued.

"Any more?"

"Give me a chance," the old man scowled, glaring at Pushkin, "he's not even in the ground yet!" He chuckled at his joke. "Anyway, not our problem is it?"

"No. It's never your problem." Pushkin slapped Papa Radu on the arm and turned away.

The building on Petrova, the former headquarters of the Moscow Oil Company -- MoskNefta, faced a busy intersection. It had been acquired by the State and was empty for some time until the department was born and the fledgling team took up residence on the sixth floor. Their presence had expanded across the entire twelve floors over the years. Yet, it continued to resemble the offices of an international investment bank, with its glass and marble that contrasted with the stone and plaster of the other government buildings. The home of the Office of Investigatory Affairs of the Russian Federation (Domestic and Foreign) -the _Volki_ - had no signage.

The soles of Pushkin's sneakers slipped as they hit the marbled floor of the foyer. He dripped a trail of puddle-water as he walked to the first set of security barriers. Seven armed guards stood at regular intervals in front of a barricade of toughened glass. They were top to toe in black. Balaclava-ed. Uncompromising eyes stared out from letterbox slits in the neoprene masks. No shades to hide the icy blues and tiger browns. He nodded a greeting to Aloya and Sergei who stood either side of the first security gate. As usual, they remained impassive. Pushkin splayed his right hand to align with the four rubber pegs on the hip-level reader and waited for the familiar whirr as the light passed under his palm. The gate opened. He placed his sodden satchel and newspaper onto the conveyor to be scanned and stepped through the security arch halting with a dramatic elevation of his arms. He immediately regretted this as the rain trickled inside his coat sleeves.

"Morning Rustam," he said, as the Uzbeki patted him down. He did a half-spin, one heel slipping slightly, the guard's hands hovering, waiting for the fall. "How's your brother?" Pushkin said. "Tell him he cost me a tenner last Friday." The guard remained silent, but the crease around his eyes gave away a smile as Pushkin retrieved his cargo and marched to the bank of lifts. There were eleven guards on this side of the barriers -- five huddled in a corner, two others with Belgian Malinois, paced silently; their soft boot treads squeaked on the marble in the cavernous atrium. It reminded Pushkin of the basketball game where Arslon Musayev, Rustam's brother, missed a dolly of a three-pointer to gifted the 'Red-White' -- Spartak Saint Petersburg the game and Dmitri a tenner.

Pushkin noted that there were at least five more guards than usual.

He exited the lift on the eighth floor, humming because his teeth would not allow him to whistle painlessly. The desk in the carpeted reception area was deserted.

He walked through the centre of the open plan office, passing six banks of desks, each with multiple workstations and screens, to his office on the perimeter of the circular space. Pushkin let a silent mouthing or a nod of his head act as sufficient acknowledgement of the passing greetings.

The pneumatics took the force out of the slam as he shut his office door, a hissing and then a clunk. The macintosh. Pushkin held it matador style and snapped the rain off it in one go, spattering the back of the door. He sat on his couch and removed the soaked sneakers, wringing out each sock into the bin by his side as he took them off. He inspected the puddle-wrinkled toes and the greying skin, and picked at a torn nail on a big toe.

Removing a towel from the bottom drawer of his desk, he used it to wipe his feet and then to dry his face and hair. It smelled a little. A bit musty. Not too bad. He made a note to remember to give the towel to one of the girls to wash.

There was a knock at his door as he turned to take a business suit from the wardrobe.

"Yes?"

The door opened.

"The boss is waiting to see you," said Dima.

"Oh yes?" he said, turning with an identical hangered suit in each hand. "Well, he might have to wait a little longer." He smiled at her. "Which one?" He grinned. She rolled her eyes and closed the door. It used to be such a good joke.

Pushkin returned one of the suits to the wardrobe and placed the other on the couch. He emptied his trouser pockets of sweet papers and an unwrapped boiled sweet that was now matted with dust and fibres. He had just started to unbuckle his trousers when there was another knock at his door. It opened before Pushkin had a chance to respond.

"Boss is waiting for us." Dmitri -- sleeves rolled up, tie slightly undone, fresh-faced from his early morning circuit training. He reeked of a recently extinguished cigarette, and the gaps between the buttons on the placket of his charcoal grey shirt bowed to reveal the white vest underneath.

Pushkin dropped his trousers, smiling.

Dmitri raised an eyebrow, "Have you pissed yourself again?"

"Not this time!" they both chorused.

Pushkin pulled on one leg then the other, and hopped as he held the waist. He buttoned the fly and adjusted the side-fasteners.

"How's the tooth?"

"Teeth," Pushkin said with a grimace.

"He's with some civvies as far as I can see," Dmitri said. "Tea?" He did not wait for Pushkin to answer and ducked out of the office.

"Give me ten minutes," Pushkin called after him.

Pushkin faced his office window and looked out over the smoky cityscape. It felt as if the heavens were in mourning, the clouds bloated with moisture and weeping gently. The skies would sob by midday.

Pushkin let Dmitri lead as they took the short walk to the boss's office. Dmitri looked over his shoulder at Pushkin. "What do you think?"

"It's going to be busy for a while," he said, unwrapping a toffee and placing it on the left side of his mouth, carefully folding the waxed paper into an aeroplane. He flicked it from his wrist over the bannister to the floor below. He did not bother to watch the elegant parabola and glide.

The Director of Investigations - Domestic Financial, liked to sit with the boys, but it was simply not possible, given the architect's design, to have an office on the same floor as the open plan area, so he had settled for a double office in the north west corner of the mezzanine above the eighth. Two window walls overlooked the Priya Ploshad and the Avenue of Heroes, and he was still embarrassed at the largesse five years into his post.

Two 'civilians' -- ministry men -- sat on the sofa that softened one wall of the boss's office. The boss's back was turned, but as they approached, he appeared to sense their arrival and opened the glass door, ushering Dmitri and Pushkin in.

Yvegenny Prestin was one of those bosses who just let you get on with it. He believed in star players and expected each member of the team to bring something to the game. Ten years in an Olympic squad did that. He stooped slightly. Back then his frame would scaffold a basketball hoop. He was a giant, albeit one that had forgotten to eat. His wingspan was deployed in pep talks to illustrate the enormity of a problem, pointing high to the heavens to admonish complacency, shadowing desks as he stopped to read reports. He looked older than his fifty-two years, his joints succumbing to arthritis, his hair, brushed away by harsh winters during which he refused to be capped.

"Gentlemen - Agents Pushkin and Alenin. Guys - Director Konanin and Colonel Mendev."

Prestin always dispensed with formality and titles. The two men from the Interior Ministry rose and extended manicured hands to shake those of the two investigators. Pushkin tried not to laugh. Here, standing in front of him were cartoon characters from his kindergarten years -- _Gena_ and _Cheburashka_ -- in living colour. The smaller one had the face of the -- what was that line? -- 'animal unknown to science', not the large furry ears, but the cub-like features and an upturned nose. Pushkin looked past them to their seat, and there it was -- Gena the crocodile's hat. Pushkin eyed Dmitri but there was no indication that his colleague was having the same thoughts.

Prestin half-sat on his desk, his legs stretched out facing the two men. Dmitri leaned against the hinged side of the glass door. Pushkin debated whether to try to squeeze onto the sofa with the men from the ministry, but decided, as Prestin retold the events, to wheel out the boss's chair from behind the desk and sit facing them, pressing a lever to lower the seat and allow his legs to plant feet squarely on the floor.

The man called Mendev cleared his throat and appeared to hesitate, half-rising. Then he sat and adjusted his tie.

"You have no doubt seen the news coverage of the assassination of Yuri Semyonovich Lenkov." He paused. Dmitri picked at his teeth. Pushkin stared straight at Mendev and continued to chew on one side of his mouth. The man actually sounded like Cheburashka - high-pitched and eager. Prestin folded his arms.

He continued. "We are getting a lot of flak from the British; and the Germans for that matter. It is of the utmost importance that we show them and the world that we were not involved."

Pushkin looked up. "Why do we care?"

"_Why do we care?_" Mendev looked at Prestin, who was smiling, his arms folded. "Because we had nothing to do with it."

"It's a matter of clarity then?" continued Pushkin, unwrapping another toffee and struggling to find a waste bin. Prestin lowered his hand to Pushkin and took the paper. He balled it and flicked it across the room - a three-pointer into the can.

"We need to emphasise that the Federation of Russia does not tolerate, orchestrate or sponsor terrorism."

"Let the British conduct their investigations. We can help or cooperate, and then conclude. There is little we can do right now," said Dmitri. Mendev looked at his colleague. Konanin started slowly. Pushkin imagined the dim crocodile opening its jaws.

"We will make our own inquiries." Konanin seemed like one used to having his wishes complied with. "The British have no intelligence and will not be able to gather what we have on Lenkov and his former cronies. There is no doubt that whomever perpetrated this crime is most definitely our problem."

That seemed to conclude matters. Konanin rose and approached Prestin extending his hand. "Please report through me and Colonel Mendev. We will keep the Security Council informed. And let's have for daily updates."

Mendev rose and took Prestin's hand and smiled. Prestin showed them out, walking them to his secretary's workstation and clapping both on the shoulder as he left them.

"Right," he said, shutting the glass door. Pushkin returned the boss's chair and moved to the sofa.

Dmitri stayed by the door. "What was that all about?"

"Well. As you may have gathered, the men from the ministry don't like it when a political candidate is eliminated without their permission."

Pushkin frowned.

Prestin pointed a remote control at the flat screen above the sofa. Pushkin had to twist in his seat. He played the footage of the assassination. They watched in silence. He switched off the footage as the camera angled tilted and defocused after the first blast.

"The international protests are secondary, but not unimportant, and thank God it happened in London and not down the road. But still. They really don't like it. Some bright spark suggested arresting the 'top table' -- Lavrov, Shuman, Patrushev, Stepanov. But all fingers are pointing towards St Basil's."

Dmitri shook his head. "Lenkov obviously pissed someone off, but you don't man an operation like this -- in London -- just because someone's kicked you in the nuts. Yuri Semyonovich really screwed up here."

"We have the budget to run a Level One investigation and we have guarantees in place with the other sections. I'll be meeting with the heads today, but we lead. And on that note, I would like Dmitri to run this." He said this looking at Pushkin directly, then he turned and extended his hand to Dmitri. "And congratulations. About time." Dmitri nodded and appeared to avoid Pushkin's gaze.

"Sasha, I need you to do what you do best. We have the budget, but time is the factor. If they think that they can get away with this, then who's next? And believe me, any more dead oligarchs or political opponents and the Kremlin will have no option but to care about international action."

"Dmitri's operation will be our official face -- Sasha, let's keep your work between ourselves. That doesn't leave this room. Just you, no one else. Is that okay?"

Pushkin nodded. "Boss."

Dmitri smiled, then appeared to blush as Pushkin looked at him.

"Right, Go! I have work to do." He opened the door and shooed them out.

"Well done buddy," Pushkin said as they reached his office.

"I was going to tell you yesterday, but...."

"Hey. No problem. Well done - Commander." Pushkin laughed and entered his office. Dmitri hovered at the door.

"Listen, let's chat later. I need to put a team together. Actually, why don't you come too?"

"No. No. Needs to be clear you're in charge. Go. Go. I have to keep my end up." Dmitri smiled and left. Pushkin looked across Moscow. _Why can't we just leave things be?_ He barked his shin as he attempted a half-hearted kick at the sofa.

# Chapter Four

_Moscow, Russia_

The names came to mind very easily. The usual suspects: Mikhail Stepanov, Boris Bovarin and Grigoriy Torchinovich -- all business associates of Lenkov. They would be the first. Interviewing the British witnesses would not be possible. Pushkin would not be able to interview the security detail or any of Lenkov's staff. That just left Lenkov's business beneficiaries: the editors of his media outlets, including the editor of _Otkraveniya Gazeta_, Anna Petrova.

Pushkin retrieved the names and photos of the victims that had been positively identified by the British police --

- Yuri Lenkov
- Matthew Beecham - The driver. 34.
- Joseph Capp - The close protection officer. 42. Former soldier - Irish Guards.
- Chris Honeywell - The driver of the second car. 45 - ex Metropolitan Police officer.
- Glenn Collins - The close protection officer in the front passenger seat. 38.

But no Yulia. Nothing in the initial report.

That reminded Pushkin to check something that had niggled at him earlier when he had reviewed the footage with the boss and Dmitri - he had not seen Yulia get in a car. She was not by Lenkov's side when he had dropped his coat; that had been the close protection officer -- Capp. Pushkin got up from the sofa to sit in front of his computer terminals. He plugged a docking station cable into his laptop and the two monitors that flanked it flickered into life. He searched for the footage from MosMedia and the mobile phone footage provided by one of the Phoenix supporters.

Pushkin watched as the footage from MosMedia played. It was shot from directly in front of the entrance to the television studio entrance. The crew had positioned itself on a raised platform behind the crowd control barriers that lined the pavement. Surrounding the crew were Phoenix supporters with placards and banners. The entire footage ran for over three minutes before there was any activity. Then, the security detail could be seen tapping their headset earphones and mics and taking up their rehearsed positions. The skeleton police presence was augmented with the television station's security staff. They directed cars away from the entrance and exit to the studio drive and controlled traffic in the road between the entrance and the crowd opposite.

Then the glass doors started to revolve. First, another close protection officer -- Collins, then Lenkov emerged, an overcoat draped over his shoulder, then one hand aloft pointing skyward. Pushkin glimpsed Yulia walk out next, then she waited at the top of the steps that Lenkov was descending. Flashes.

Pushkin pressed play on the second monitor and synced the two films at six minutes and forty-two seconds on the first reel - when the social secretary for Phoenix UK switched on her mobile phone to video. The angle of her shot was in a diagonal line from the entrance - she must have been standing to the extreme left of the camera crew.

Lenkov descended the steps and moved towards the car. Pushkin could see Yulia, clutching a folder to her chest and staying in the shadows as Lenkov posed for photographs. Lenkov saluted the crowd. The main point-of-view of the footage from MosMedia was blinded occasionally by the pops of flash, but from the mobile phone footage, Pushkin could see Yulia clearly, though still in shadow.

Pushkin reviewed the tape: At seven minutes thirty, as Lenkov lifts himself onto the car sill, the coat drops and is grabbed by Capp. Looking back at the mobile phone footage, it appears that Yulia is either answering a phone call or making one. Lenkov climbs into the car and the car door is shut. Yulia turns and walks towards a side entrance. When the car explodes at eight minutes ten, Yulia is not in the frame. Out of the picture.

Pushkin restarted the two videos, his head tracked back and forth between the two monitors, eyes on the timestamps. Confirmed. At eight minutes thirty, Yulia Tolbanova is nowhere to be seen.

Pushkin hovered at the glass door two offices along from his. Dmitri was sat at a round table in deep discussion with two of his team. Pushkin tapped, then opened the door, peeking his head in.

"Yulia Tolbanova is not dead," he said.

Dmitri capped the pen he was holding and leaned back in his chair. The two junior officers remained hunched over the table of photographs and files. Pushkin walked in and perched on the edge of Dmitri's desk so that Dmitri had to angle his head over his left shoulder to see Pushkin.

"She went back into the building, or to the side of the television studio building some moments before the explosion."

Dmitri looked up at the ceiling, then back at Pushkin. He shook his head. "Not dead," he said.

"Well, to be more accurate, she was almost certainly not in the car that exploded nor the second that sustained damage. If she is dead, she did not die in the explosion." Pushkin stood up and walked over to the spider chart on the wall opposite the desk. He pointed at the picture of Mikhail Stepanov. "A suspect? Really?" Pushkin laughed.

"We are looking at all possible routes of inquiry," said Anastasia Limonova, an eager analyst who had joined recently from Section Seven.

"Okay. Unlikely though. Let me know when you find Miss Tolbanova," Pushkin said, leaving the three to figure out the revelation.

Pushkin was about to put the phone down when the 'burner' phone started to ring. He answered it, expecting it to be one of Mikhail's secretaries, but it was Mikhail himself.

[Mikhail berates Pushkin for not having spoken to him in such a long time and asks how his life is. Pushkin tells him. Pushkin feels like an underachiever and questions his progression through the force. Mikhail asks Pushkin about his personal life. Pushkin wants to just arrange a face to face meeting, but feels compelled to ask him about Natalya and the girls. They are doing well. They are in England.]

[Pushkin broaches the subject of the investigation and positions it as helping an old mate understand Lenkov - not for hockey tickets then, Mikhail jokes. Pushkin jokes that he is seeing a match on Friday and Mikhail offers to get him better tickets. Pushkin thanks him buts says that that would be embarrassing for the colleague with the standard tickets. He understands, says this is typical of Sasha.]

[Mikhail tells Pushkin that he will be in Moscow briefly next week and this his assistant will make arrangements. They say their farewells. Barely a second passes and the phone rings again. It is Mikhail's assistant offering a time and place. He accepts.]

Pushkin returned to his office. Where Dmitri and his junior officers had photographs, coloured ribbons, cards and spider charts, he had a laptop and two screens.

He had asked the guys in Data to create a private space for him on their network, where he could store intelligence documents and create his own resources. He had written some queries to extract data from the various databases, asking one of the analysts to write the code where some obscure reference data was in use, but in all, he did most of the programming himself, a far cry from his computer science electives that he had taken under Boris Bovarin at the Institute, where he had manually entered hundreds of rows into DB2 tables with clunky retrieval into text files. Now, he was using natural languages on graph databases to look up edge relationships.

Bovarin would know. He would know. He would have the theories about Lenkov's murder. Pushkin looked through the 400 pages of court transcript from the _Bovarin v Stepanovs & Ors_. The trial had ended two months ago and a judgment was expected in the next few weeks. Pushkin walked to the office kitchen and made himself a pot of tea, which he carried back to his office with a mug and a spoon. He placed the pot on his desk and poured the tea and sat down on the couch to read the documents.

[Pushkin reads the court documents and we get a sense of Bovarin and Stepanov and their wealth in the transcripts. It is written from the point of view as if Pushkin is in court, though we are able to learn more about the characters outside of Pushkin's purview]

[The whole chapter is devoted to the court case and we see Natalya, Denton Barret and Yuri Lenkov (witness) and Yulia and start seeding the notion of Irish involvement].

It was dark outside as Pushkin picked up his mobile to make the call. There was an answer on the second ring.

"Good Afternoon,. Ultimir Bank. How can I help you?"

"Mikhail Stepanov." Pushkin said.

"Who may I say is calling?"

Pushkin hesitated. Should he use his official title? "Pushkin, Aleksandr Ivanovich," he said, then added "I'm an old friend."

"Please hold."

There was some music. _Op20:Scene_ from _Swan Lake_. Pushkin pretended to conduct an orchestra and waltzed around his office as outside eyes watched him through the half-frosted glass walls of his office.

"Mr Pushkin, good afternoon. My name is Dima Nabakova. I am Mr Stepanov's second assistant. I'm afraid that he is in London until Friday. Perhaps I can take your number and come back to you?"

"It's..." he stalled. He pulled out a notepad from his drawer. "Hold on. I've forgotten my new number." Pushkin balanced his phone in the crook of his neck and removed a small envelope from the drawer and unwrapped it. He pulled out a phone card and a security slip. He copied the number onto the notepad. He read out the new number to Miss Nabakova.

"May I ask what this is about Mr Pushkin?"

Pushkin smiled to himself. Clearly they had checked him out. "Just an old friend calling for a chat. It's been a while," he said.

"Very well Mr Pushkin. I will pass on your message. Good day."

"Good day." Pushkin disconnected the line. Goodness, he thought, their clockwork wheels will be whizzing.

[Pushkin preps the new burner phone].

[Pushkin changes into his non office clothes].

Pushkin had pulled on his macintosh ready to call it a day when his phone buzzed as he picked it up.

"Listening."

"Sasha" It was a low melodic sound. "Long time. How are you?"

Pushkin imagined Mikhail Stepanov seated in a plush leather armchair with a cigar to hand, such was the comfort his the caller's tone. Pushkin imagined a wood panelled office, a flunky at hand and a glass of brandy waiting.

"Mikhail. I have only just left you a message."

"Yes. Which is why I have called back immediately. Always happy to hear from an old friend. How are you? And work?" Mikhail said.

"Work is fine Mikhail. In fact, it is why I am calling."

"Straight to the point, no chat." Stepanov laughed and Pushkin could hear the soft inhale and blow. "So, fire away."

"I'm one of many looking at the Lenkov assassination. Could I take up some of your time?"

"Absolutely. Face-to-face?"

"Preferably," said Pushkin.

"Well, I'm back in Moscow next week. We can fix up a time from you and?"

"Just me," Pushkin said.

"Okay. Well, we can fix up some time with you then." There was a pause. Pushkin was not sure how to end the call. Then he asked "How are the children? Natalya?"

"Fine. Fine. Little English madams. They will be on holiday from tomorrow, the God help me!" Stepanov laughed. "And you? How's ...?"

"Katya," Pushkin said.

"Yes. How is she? How are you both?"

"Very well, yes. Very busy."

"Fantastic. We must do something more... social. Do something when I'm back in town. Well, I'll get someone to arrange an appointment. Speak soon." There was a click as Mikhail Stepanov ended the call.

Pushkin was placing the second phone in his pocket when it started to ring. "I'm listening."

"Mr Pushkin? It is Dima from Mr Stepanov's office. Is next Thursday at 11:00 convenient?"

Pushkin thought for a moment. "Yes. That should be fine."

"Do you have our address Mr Pushkin?"

"Yes. 360 Arbat."

"That is correct. Please report reception, and please bring some identification with you."

"Identification?" Pushkin said.

"Yes Mr Pushkin. A driving licence or a passport will be sufficient," she said.

Pushkin smiled, "Yes, I'm sure I have one of those somewhere."

"Goodbye Mr Pushkin."

"Goodbye," he said.
