### Chapter 1

In London, the leader of the Phoenix Party of Change, **YURI LENKOV** conducts a television interview, during which, he defends the contradictions between his wealth, faith, and new allegiance with the Kremlin.

### Chapter 2

Lenkov leaves the London studio building and is met with a crowd of his supporters. As he leaves with his security detail, his car explodes, killing Lenkov and a number of his bodyguards.

### Chapter 3

Meanwhile in Moscow, **Aleksandr Pushkin** returns from a visit to the dentist and slumps in his living room with a bottle of vodka and sweets.

### Chapter 4

When his girlfriend, **KATYA** arrives, she is angry with him for eating sweets and racking up a dentist bill. Then she tells him that Lenkov has been killed in London. Pushkin checks his phone and finds that he has missed a number of calls. He rewatches Lenkov's interview on television.

### Chapter 5

**ANNA POPOV** knows that she is being followed and that her life is in danger. She is a childhood friend of Pushkin, a journalist, and one of the original supporters of the Phoenix Party.

### Chapter 6

In the morning, Pushkin goes to work at the Ministry of Investigatory Affairs -- the Volki. He is called into a meeting with his partner **DMITRI**, his boss **YEVGENIY PRESTIN**, and with two officers from the FSB. They want a swift investigation into LENKOV's assassination. Pushkin is assigned to work on his own while DMITRI, who has been recently promoted above Pushkin, will lead a separate team.

## Act 2: Rising Action

### Chapter 7

Pushkin decides to contact his old university mentor and oligarch, **Boris Bovarin**. Boris was also an influence on both **Mikhail Stepanov** and Yuri Lenkov. He is now in a protracted legal case against the Stepanovs. Pushkin meets Yuri at a restaurant in London. Pushkin thinks that Boris's security are amateurs. As they leave the restaurant, Bovarin is taken ill with suspected poisoning. Pushkin needs to get out of London as soon as possible as he will be a suspect. He is not on official business, so arranges for a private jet to fly him out of the UK as soon as possible. It is later revealed that Boris Bovarin was not poisoned. He was ill because he has a shellfish allergy, but had ignored doctor's advice.

### Chapter 8

Pushkin is contacted by Anna. She is convinced that LENKOV was not assassinated by the usual suspects, the Kremlin or the FSB. She has a contact with information who is willing to meet Pushkin in Rotterdam.

### Chapter 9

Reluctantly, Pushkin follows the trail to Rotterdam. On the flight, he flirts with an air stewardess and agrees to meet with her and her colleagues at a bar later.

### Chapter 10

Pushkin arrives at the bar early and watches from outside, making sure that he is not being followed and that the location is secure. He is suspicious that the air hostess is not what she seems.

### Chapter 11

Pushkin enters the bar and finds the air stewardess with her friends. They continue to flirt, but Pushkin draws the line at anything going further. The air stewardess and her colleagues leave. Anna's contact calls Pushkin and arranges to meet at the bar that Pushkin is at. The voice is of a female.

## Act 3: Climax

### Chapter 12

An attractive woman approaches Pushkin at the bar. She says just enough for Pushkin to think that she is Anna's contact. They have one drink together, then she takes his hand and they walk out of the bar. Pushkin is unsteady on his feet. His eyes blur, and he collapses on the pavement.

### Chapter 13

Pushkin wakes up in a hotel room. He has a throbbing headache, like he has been drugged. As he gets up to go to the bathroom, he sees a young woman, the one he left the bar with collapsed on the floor, blood forming a halo around her head. Pushkin panics. He hears his phone ringing and he picks it up. The voice on the other end tells him to get out of the hotel now. Killers are coming to get him.

### Chapter 14

Meanwhile, in Moscow, Anna visits a nightclub where the owner is an old friend. She leaves a secret message in a cigarette packet for Pushkin to find. She is resigned to her fate. She will either be killed soon, or her terminal illness will claim her. She is not frightened.

### Chapter 15

Pushkin escapes and walks the city until midnight, then breaks cover to go to the Russian Embassy. In the embassy, he speaks with a diplomat, then calls Dmitri and tells him to find Anna and protect her. He tries desperately to contact Anna, but cannot get through.

### Chapter 16

Pushkin calls in favours from the criminal underworld in Moscow and it is arranged for him to leave the country in a private jet. Pushkin arrives at the airport and is met by Dmitri. Dmitri has bad news. Anna has been found drowned in Patriarch's Ponds.

### Chapter 17

Anna's funeral is conducted by her brother, **Andrey**. A rebel priest with followers called 'the Flock', mostly made up of former criminals, far-right hooligans, and army veterans. They wear cassocks and use bird sounds to warn each other of danger. Pushkin tries to find out if Andrey knew whether Anna had enemies. Andrey replies that she had too many.

## Act 4: Falling Action

### Chapter 18

Pushkin is shocked by Anna's death and demands to meet with **Mikhail Stepanov**. They meet at Stepanov's lavish offices. The meeting is interrupted by **Natalya**, who arrives with her twin daughters. Pushkin thinks that the girls look like him.

### Chapter 19

Shortly after the meeting, Mikhail Stepanov calls to arrange another meeting. Pushkin is worried, and arranges to meet Mikhail at a nightclub owned by his friend, **Misha**. Stepanov arrives with a security detail and suggests that he and Pushkin take a walk as he needs to walk his dog.

### Chapter 20

Stepanov confesses that he thinks that his wife **Natalya Stepanova**, Pushkin's ex-wife, may have been involved in Yuri Lenkov's murder. At the end of their meeting, Stepanov gives Pushkin a USB stick and says there should be information on it that can help Pushkin. As Stepanov leaves in his car, his car explodes and he is killed. Pushkin is slammed against a wall by the blast and is seriously injured and hospitalised.

### Chapter 21

In hospital, Pushkin has to rely on Dmitri to pursue the investigation. While Katya, his girlfriend, is visiting, she sees some of the files that Dmitri has brought with him. She looks at a picture and identifies Yuri's personal assistant, who was not caught in the blast, but has disappeared. She is known as **YULIA**, but Katya reveals that that is not her real name. She recognises her from her modelling days. Yulia is part-Dutch and her name is actually **AUGUSTA**.

### Chapter 22

Pushkin checks the USB stick that Mikhail Stepanov gave him before his death. It contains financial transactions. They appear unexplained and not legitimate. It also appears that Natalya Stepanova authorised the payments.

### Chapter 23

While recuperating, and after leaving hospital, Pushkin is at a restaurant owned by friends of Katya's, when two men enter. They work for Andrey Popov and ask Pushkin to accompany them to see Andrey at his boxing club gym. They tell Pushkin that an army veteran arrived at their doors asking for forgiveness, as he was involved in Anna Popov's murder.

### Chapter 24

At the boxing club gym, Pushkin questions the man, called **Leonid**. Leonid claims that he was hired to keep watch on Anna and witnessed her murder. He thinks that those who hired him now want him dead.

### Chapter 25

A commotion breaks out as gunshots are heard. Andrey guides Pushkin and Leonid into a basement room, and promises to come back for them. Leonid prays while in the room with Pushkin as they hear footsteps outside the door. It is clear that they are trapped. Leonid takes advantage of Pushkin's weakness and pushing him over, runs to the door and exits. Pushkin hears two gunshots. Leonid is dead. Some minutes later, Pushkin's partner, Dmitri arrives with his team and armed guards. Pushkin is dropped at his apartment.

## Act 5: Resolution

### Chapter 26

Katya has a surprise for Pushkin. She has found Augusta. It is revealed that Augusta was Anna's contact in Rotterdam and she was meant to have met Pushkin in Rotterdam. She had sent another girl in her place as a decoy. She had also called to warn Pushkin.

### Chapter 27

Augusta reveals that **Natalya Stepanova** was responsible for the assassination of Yuri Lenkov. This is because he was being groomed by the Russian Orthodox Church and would have been a more autocratic leader. She felt that she had no option. Augusta suspects that she killed Anna, because Anna had been in on the conspiracy, but then changed her mind. Augusta also suspects that Natalya ordered the killing of Mikhail Stepanov, and the attempt on Pushkin, that left Leonid dead.

### Chapter 28

Pushkin builds a case against Natalya, and then confronts her. Natalya has the upper hand. She has taken Katya hostage. After a few days of keeping the truth to himself and misleading Dmitri and his boss, Pushkin yields to Natalya's demands.

### Chapter 29

As Natalya waits for her private plane to take off for London, with her daughters, her team, and Pushkin, whom she has taken hostage, armed guards storm the plane. It is Dimitri and his team. They tell Pushkin that Katya was safe and with Andrey Popov.

### Chapter 30

Pushkin keeps his promise to Mikhail Stepanov, and takes the Stepanov twins to go to live in the UK with Boris Bovarin.
