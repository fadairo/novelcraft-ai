  "paragraph_summary": "One-sentence summary expanded into a paragraph:\n\nAfter his ex-wife, a high-ranking government official, is assassinated, Russian investigator Mikhail Volkov is tasked with uncovering the truth behind her death. As he delves deeper into the case, he uncovers evidence of a vast political conspiracy, leading to a shocking revelation that his ex-wife was the mastermind behind a deadly plot to overthrow the government (25% mark). Midway through his investigation, Mikhail's partner is killed, and he realizes the conspiracy extends far beyond what he initially suspected (50% mark). With the stakes higher than ever and more lives at risk, Mikhail races against time to stop the impending coup, only to discover that his own daughter has been kidnapped by the conspirators as leverage (75% mark). In a heart-pounding climax, Mikhail must choose between saving his daughter or preventing the assassination of the country's leader, ultimately exposing the truth and bringing the conspirators to justice.",
  "page_summary": "After his bitter divorce, Mikhail Volkov, a seasoned investigator for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), had distanced himself from his ex-wife, Natalia Ivanova, a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Defense. Their once-passionate relationship had deteriorated into a toxic battle of wills, leaving Mikhail disillusioned and focused solely on his work.\n\nThe inciting incident occurred when Mikhail received a frantic call from his former father-in-law, informing him that Natalia had been assassinated in a brazen attack outside her office. Despite their strained relationship, Mikhail felt compelled to uncover the truth behind her death.\n\nAs he delved deeper into the case, Mikhail uncovered evidence of a vast political conspiracy, leading to a shocking revelation that his ex-wife, Natalia, was the mastermind behind a deadly plot to overthrow the government (25% mark). Her position within the Ministry of Defense had granted her access to classified information and resources, which she had exploited to orchestrate a coup d'état.\n\nMidway through his investigation, Mikhail's trusted partner, Yuri Kovalev, was brutally murdered, and he realized the conspiracy extended far beyond what he initially suspected (50% mark). The stakes were raised, and Mikhail found himself in a perilous situation, facing powerful forces determined to silence him at any cost.\n\nWith the threat of an impending coup looming, Mikhail raced against time to stop the conspirators' plans. However, in a chilling turn of events, he received a ransom demand from the conspirators – his own daughter, Anya, had been kidnapped and was being held as leverage (75% mark). Mikhail was faced with an agonizing choice: save his daughter or prevent the assassination of the country's leader, risking the stability of the nation.\n\nIn a heart-pounding climax, Mikhail orchestrated a daring rescue operation, narrowly saving Anya's life while simultaneously exposing the truth about Natalia's treacherous plot. With the help of loyal allies within the FSB, he managed to apprehend the key conspirators, including several high-ranking officials who had been working in collusion with Natalia.\n\nAs the dust settled, Mikhail came to terms with the devastating realization that his ex-wife had been willing to sacrifice everything, including their daughter's life, in her quest for power. The resolution brought a sense of closure, but also left Mikhail grappling with the harsh reality that the woman he once loved had been capable of such betrayal and deceit.",
