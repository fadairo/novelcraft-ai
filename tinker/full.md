PARTI

1

The truth is, if old Major Dover hadn’t dropped dead at Taunton races Jim would
never have come to Thursgood’s at all. He came in mid-term without an
interview—late May, it was, though no one would have thought it from the
weather—employed through one of the shiftier agencies specialising in supply
teachers for prep schools, to hold down old Dover’s teaching till someone
suitable could be found. “A linguist,” Thursgood told the common-room, “a
temporary measure,” and brushed away his forelock in self-defence. “Priddo.”

He gave the spelling, “P-R-l-D”—French was not Thursgood’s subject so he
consulted the slip of paper—“E-A-U-X, first name James. 1 think he’ll do us
very well till July.” The staff had no difficulty in reading the signals. Jim
Prideaux was a poor white of the teaching community. He belonged to the same
sad bunch as the late Mrs. Loveday, who had a Persian-lamb coat and stood in
for junior divinity until her cheques bounced, or the late Mr. Maltby, the pianist
who had been called from choir practice to help the police with their enquiries,
and as far as anyone knew was helping them to this day, for Maltby’s trunk still
lay in the cellar awaiting instructions. Several of the staff, but chiefly
Marjoribanks, were in favour of opening that trunk. They said it contained
notorious missing treasures: Aprahamian’s silver-framed picture of his Lebanese
mother, for instance; Best-lngram’s Swiss army penknife and Matron’s watch.
But Thursgood set his creaseless face resolutely against their entreaties. Only
five years had passed since he had inherited the school from his father, but they
had taught him already that some things are best locked away.

Jim Prideaux arrived on a Friday in a rainstorm. The rain rolled like gun-
smoke down the brown combes of the Quantocks, then raced across the empty
cricket fields into the sandstone of the crumbling faq:ades. He arrived just after
lunch, driving an old red Alvis and towing a second-hand trailer that had once
been blue. Early afternoons at Thursgood’s are tranquil, a brief truce in the
running fight of each school day. The boys are sent to rest in their dormitories,
the staff sit in the common-room over coffee reading newspapers or correcting
boys’ work. Thursgood reads a novel to his mother. Of the whole school,
therefore, only little Bill Roach actually saw Jim arrive, saw the steam belching
from the Alvis’s bonnet as it wheezed its way down the pitted drive, windscreen
wipers going full pelt and the trailer shuddering through the puddles in pursuit.

Roach was a new boy in those days and graded dull, if not actually deficient.
Thursgood’s was his second prep school in two terms. He was a fat round child

with asthma, and he spent large parts of his rest kneeling on the end of his bed,
gazing through the window. His mother lived grandly in Bath; his father was
agreed to be the richest in the school, a distinction which cost the son dear.
Coming from a broken home. Roach was also a natural watcher. In Roach’s
observation Jim did not stop at the school buildings but continued across the
sweep to the stable yard. He knew the layout of the place already. Roach decided
later that he must have made a reconnaissance or studied maps. Even when he
reached the yard, he didn’t stop but drove straight onto the wet grass, travelling
at speed to keep the momentum. Then over the hummock into the Dip, head-first
and out of sight. Roach half expected the trailer to jackknife on the brink, Jim
took it over so fast, but instead it just lifted its tail and disappeared like a giant
rabbit into its hole.

The Dip is a piece of Thursgood folklore. It lies in a patch of wasteland
between the orchard, the fruit house, and the stable yard. To look at, it is no more
than a depression in the ground, grass covered, with hummocks on the northern
side, each about boy height and covered in tufted thickets which in summer grow
spongy. It is these hummocks that give the Dip its special virtue as a playground
and also its reputation, which varies with the fantasy of each new generation of
boys. They are the traces of an open-cast silver mine, says one year, and digs
enthusiastically for wealth. They are a Romano-British fort, says another, and
stages battles with sticks and clay missiles. To others the Dip is a bomb-crater
from the war and the hummocks are seated bodies buried in the blast. The truth
is more prosaic. Six years ago, and not long before his abrupt elopement with a
receptionist from the Castle Hotel, Thursgood’s father had launched an appeal
for a swimming pool and persuaded the boys to dig a large hole with a deep and
a shallow end. But the money that came in was never quite enough to finance the
ambition, so it was frittered away on other schemes, such as a new projector for
the art school, and a plan to grow mushrooms in the school cellars. And even,
said the cruel ones, to feather a nest for certain illicit lovers when they
eventually took flight to Germany, the lady’s native home.

Jim was unaware of these associations. The fact remains that by sheer luck he
had chosen the one corner of Thursgood’s academy which, as far as Roach was
concerned, was endowed with supernatural properties.

Roach waited at the window but saw nothing more. Both the Alvis and the
trailer were in dead ground, and if it hadn’t been for the wet red tracks across the
grass he might have wondered whether he had dreamed the whole thing. But the
tracks were real, so when the bell went for the end of rest he put on his rubber
boots and trudged through the rain to the top of the Dip and peered down, and
there was Jim dressed in an army raincoat and a quite extraordinary hat.

broadbrimmed like a safari hat but hairy, with one side pinned up in a rakish
piratical curl and the water running off it like a gutter.

The Alvis was in the stable yard; Roach never knew how Jim spirited it out of
the Dip, but the trailer was right down there, at what should have been the deep
end, bedded on platforms of weathered brick, and Jim was sitting on the step
drinking from a green plastic beaker, and rubbing his right shoulder as if he had
banged it on something, while the rain poured off his hat. Then the hat lifted and
Roach found himself staring at an extremely fierce red face, made still fiercer by
the shadow of the brim and by a brown moustache washed into fangs by the rain.
The rest of the face was criss-crossed with jagged cracks, so deep and crooked
that Roach concluded in another of his flashes of imaginative genius that Jim
had once been very hungry in a tropical place and filled up again since. The left
arm still lay across his chest, the right shoulder was still drawn high against his
neck. But the whole tangled shape of him was stock-still, he was like an animal
frozen against its background: a stag, thought Roach, on a hopeful impulse;
something noble.

“Who the hell are you?” asked a very military voice.

“Sir, Roach, sir. Tm a new boy.”

For a moment longer, the brick face surveyed Roach from the shadow of the
hat. Then, to his intense relief, its features relaxed into a wolfish grin, the left
hand, still clapped over the right shoulder, resumed its slow massage while at the
same time he managed a long pull from the plastic beaker.

“New boy, eh?” Jim repeated into the beaker, still grinning. “Well, that’s a
lucky break, I will say.”

Rising now, and turning his crooked back on Roach, Jim set to work on what
appeared to be a detailed study of the trailer’s four legs, a very critical study that
involved much rocking of the suspension, and much tilting of the strangely
garbed head, and the emplacement of several bricks at different angles and
points. Meanwhile the spring rain was clattering down on everything: his coat,
his hat, and the roof of the old trailer. And Roach noticed that throughout these
manoeuvres Jim’s right shoulder had not budged at all but stayed wedged high
against his neck like a rock under the mackintosh. Therefore he wondered
whether Jim was a sort of giant hunchback and whether all hunch backs hurt as
Jim’s did. And he noticed as a generality, a thing to store away, that people with
bad backs take long strides; it was something to do with balance.

“New boy, eh? Well, I’m not a new boy,” Jim went on, in altogether a much
more friendly tone, as he pulled at a leg of the trailer. “I’m an old boy. Old as
Rip van Winkle, if you want to know. Older. Got any friends?”

“No, sir,” said Roach simply, in the listless tone that schoolboys always use

for saying “no,” leaving all positive response to their interrogators. Jim,
however, made no response at all, so that Roach felt an odd stirring of kinship
suddenly, and of hope.

“My other name’s Bill,” he said. “I was christened Bill but Mr. Thursgood
calls me William.”

“Bill, eh. The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that?”

“No, sir.”

“Good name, anyway.”

“Yes, sir.”

“Known a lot of Bills. They’ve all been good’uns.”

With that, in a manner of speaking, the introduction was made. Jim did not tell
Roach to go away, so Roach stayed on the brow peering downward through his
rain-smeared spectacles. The bricks, he noticed with awe, were pinched from the
cucumber frame. Several had been loose already and Jim must have loosened
them a bit more. It seemed a wonderful thing to Roach that anyone just arrived at
Thursgood’s should be so self-possessed as to pinch the actual fabric of the
school for his own purposes, and doubly wonderful that Jim had run a lead off
the hydrant for his water, for that hydrant was the subject of a special school
rule: to touch it at all was a beatable offence.

“Hey, you. Bill. You wouldn’t have such a thing as a marble on you, by any
chance?”

“A, sir, what, sir?” Roach asked, patting his pockets in a dazed way.

“Marble, old boy. Round glass marble, little ball. Don’t boys play marbles any
more? We did when I was at school.”

Roach had no marble, but Aprahamian had had a whole collection flown in
from Beirut. It took Roach about fifty seconds to race back to the school, secure
one against the wildest undertakings, and return panting to the Dip. There he
hesitated, for in his mind the Dip was already Jim’s and Roach required leave to
descend it. But Jim had disappeared into the trailer, so, having waited a moment.
Roach stepped gingerly down the bank and offered the marble through the
doorway. Jim didn’t spot him at once. He was sipping from the beaker and
staring out the window at the black clouds as they tore this way and that over the
Quantocks. This sipping movement. Roach noticed, was actually quite difficult,
for Jim could not easily swallow standing up straight; he had to tilt his whole
twisted trunk backward to achieve the angle. Meanwhile the rain came on really
hard again, rattling against the trailer like gravel.

“Sir,” said Roach, but Jim made no move.

“Trouble with an Alvis is, no damn springs,” said Jim at last, more to the
window than to his visitor. “You drive along with your rump on the white line.

eh? Cripple anybody.” And, tilting his trunk again, he drank.

“Yes, sir,” said Roach, much surprised that Jim should assume he was a driver.

Jim had taken off his hat. His sandy hair was close-cropped; there were
patches where someone had gone too low with the scissors. These patches were
mainly on one side, so that Roach guessed that Jim had cut the hair himself with
his good arm, which made him even more lopsided.

“I brought you a marble,” said Roach.

“Very good of you. Thanks, old boy.” Taking the marble, he slowly rolled it
round his hard, powdery palm, and Roach knew at once that he was very skillful
at all sorts of things; that he was the kind of man who lived on terms with tools
and objects generally. “Not level, you see. Bill,” he confided, still intent upon the
marble. “Skewy. Like me. Watch,” and turned purposefully to the larger window.
A strip of aluminium beading ran along the bottom, put there to catch the
condensation. Laying the marble in it, Jim watched it roll to the end and fall on
the floor.

“Skewy,” he repeated. “Listing in the stern. Can’t have that, can we? Hey, hey,
where d’you get to, you little brute?”

The trailer was not a homey place. Roach noticed, stooping to retrieve the
marble. It might have belonged to anyone, though it was scrupulously clean. A
bunk, a kitchen chair, a ship’s stove, a calor gas cylinder. Not even a picture of
his wife, thought Roach, who had not yet met a bachelor, with the exception of
Mr. Thursgood. The only personal things he could find were a webbing kit-bag
hanging from the door, a set of sewing things stored beside the bunk, and a
homemade shower made from a perforated biscuit tin and neatly welded to the
roof. And on the table one bottle of colourless drink, gin or vodka, because that
was what his father drank when Roach went to his flat for weekends in the
holidays.

“East-west looks okay, but north-south is undoubtedly skewy,” Jim declared,
testing the other window ledge. “What are you good at. Bill?”

“I don’t know, sir,” said Roach woodenly.

“Got to be good at something, surely; everyone is. How about football? Are
you good at football. Bill?”

“No, sir,” said Roach.

“Are you a grind, then?” Jim asked carelessly, as he lowered himself with a
short grunt onto the bed and took a pull from the beaker. “You don’t look a
grind, I must say,” he added politely. “Although you’re a loner.”

“I don’t know,” Roach repeated, and moved half a pace towards the open
door.

“What’s your best thing, then?” He took another long sip. “Must be good at

something, Bill; everyone is. My best thing was ducks and drakes. Cheers.”

Now this was an unfortunate question to ask of Roach just then, for it
occupied most of his waking hours. Indeed he had recently come to doubt
whether he had any purpose on earth at all. In work and play he considered
himself seriously inadequate; even the daily routine of the school, such as
making his bed and tidying his clothes, seemed to be beyond his reach. Also he
lacked piety: old Mrs. Thursgood had told him so; he screwed up his face too
much at chapel. He blamed himself very much for these shortcomings, but most
of all he blamed himself for the break-up of his parents’ marriage, which he
should have seen coming and taken steps to prevent. He even wondered whether
he was more directly responsible; whether, for instance, he was abnormally
wicked or divisive or slothful, and that his bad character had wrought the rift. At
his last school he had tried to explain this by screaming, and feigning fits of
cerebral palsy, which his aunt had. His parents conferred, as they frequently did
in their reasonable way, and changed his school. Therefore this chance question,
levelled at him in the cramped trailer by a creature at least halfway to divinity—
a fellow solitary, at that—brought him suddenly very near disaster. He felt the
heat charging to his face; he watched his spectacles mist over and the trailer
begin to dissolve into a sea of grief. Whether Jim noticed this. Roach never
knew, for suddenly he had turned his crooked back on him, moved away to the
table, and was helping himself from the plastic beaker while he threw out saving
phrases.

“You’re a good watcher, anyway. I’ll tell you that for nothing, old boy. Us
singles always are—no one to rely on, what? Nobody else spotted me. Gave me
a real turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a juju man. Best
watcher in the unit. Bill Roach is. I’ll bet. Long as he’s got his specs on. What?”

“Yes,” Roach agreed gratefully, “I am.”

“Well, you stay here and watch, then,” Jim commanded, clapping the safari
hat back on his head, “and I’ll slip outside and trim the legs. Do that?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Where’s damn marble?”

“Here, sir.”

“Call out when she moves, right? North, south, whichever way she rolls.
Understand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Know which way’s north?”

“That way,” said Roach promptly, and struck out his arm at random.

“Right. Well, you call when she rolls,” Jim repeated, and disappeared into the
rain. A moment later. Roach felt the ground swaying under his feet and heard

another roar either of pain or anger, as Jim wrestled with a recalcitrant leg.

In the course of that same summer term, the boys paid Jim the compliment of a
nickname. They had several shots before they were happy. They tried “Trooper,”
which caught the bit of military in him, his occasional, quite harmless cursing,
and his solitary rambles in the Quantocks. All the same, “Trooper” didn’t stick,
so they tried “Pirate” and for a while “Goulash.” “Goulash” because of his taste
for hot food, the smell of curries and onions and paprika that greeted them in
warm puffs as they filed past the Dip on their way to evensong. “Goulash” for
his perfect French, which was held to have a slushy quality. Spikely, of Five B,
could imitate it to a hair: “You heard the question, Berger. What is Emile looking
at?”—a convulsive jerk of the right hand—“Don’t gawp at me, old boy. I’m not
a juju man. Qu’est-ce qu’il regarde, Emile dans le tableau que tu as sous le nez?
Mon cher Berger, if you do not very soon summon one lucid sentence of French,
je te mettrai tout de suite a la porte, tu comprends, you beastly toad?”

But these terrible threats were never carried out, either in French or in
English. In a quaint way, they actually added to the aura of gentleness which
quickly surrounded him, a gentleness only possible in big men seen through the
eyes of boys.

Yet “Goulash” did not satisfy them, either. It lacked the hint of strength
contained. It took no account of Jim’s passionate Englishness, which was the
only subject where he could be relied on to waste time. Toad Spikely had only to
venture one disparaging comment on the monarchy, extol the joys of some
foreign country, preferably a hot one, for Jim to colour sharply and snap out a
good three minutes’ worth on the privilege of being born an Englishman. He
knew they were teasing him but he was unable not to rise. Often he ended his
homily with a rueful grin, and muttered references to red herrings, and red faces
too, when certain people would have to come in for extra work and miss their
football. But England was his love; when it came down to it, no one suffered for
her.

“Best place in the whole damn world!” he bellowed once. “Know why? Know
why, toad?”

Spikely did not, so Jim seized a crayon and drew a globe. To the west,
America, he said, full of greedy fools fouling up their inheritance. To the east,
Ghina-Russia; he drew no distinction: boiler suits, prison camps, and a damn
long march to nowhere. In the middle . . .

Finally they hit on “Rhino.”

Partly this was a play on “Prideaux,” partly a reference to his taste for living

off the land and his appetite for physical exercise, which they noted constantly.
Shivering in the shower queue first thing in the morning, they would see the
Rhino pounding down Combe Lane with a rucksack on his crooked back as he
returned from his morning march. Going to bed, they could glimpse his lonely
shadow through the plastic roof of the fives court as the Rhino tirelessly attacked
the concrete wall. And sometimes, on warm evenings, from their dormitory
windows they would covertly watch him at golf, which he played with a dreadful
old iron, zigzagging across the playing fields, often after reading to them from
an extremely English adventure book: Biggies, Percy Westerman, or Jeffrey
Farnol, grabbed haphazard from the dingy library. At each stroke they waited for
the grunt as he started his backswing, and they were seldom disappointed. They
kept a meticulous score. At the staff cricket match he made twenty-five before
dismissing himself with a ball deliberately lofted to Spikely at square leg.

“Catch, toad, catch it—go on. Well done, Spikely, good lad—that’s what you’re
there for.”

He was also credited, despite his taste for tolerance, with a sound
understanding of the criminal mind. There were several examples of this, but the
most telling occurred a few days before the end of term, when Spikely
discovered in Jim’s waste-basket a draft of the next day’s examination paper, and
rented it to candidates at five new pence a time. Several boys paid their shilling
and spent an agonised night memorising answers by torchlight in their
dormitories. But when the exam came round Jim presented a quite different
paper.

“You can look at this one for nothing,” he bellowed as he sat down. And,
having hauled open his Daily Telegraph, he calmly gave himself over to the
latest counsels of the juju men, which they understood to mean almost anyone
with intellectual pretension, even if he wrote in the Queen’s cause.

There was lastly the incident of the owl, which had a separate place in their
opinion of him, since it involved death, a phenomenon to which children react
variously. The weather continuing cold, Jim brought a bucket of coal to his
classroom and one Wednesday lit it in the grate, and sat there with his back to
the warmth, reading a dictee. First some soot fell, which he ignored; then the owl
came down, a full-sized barn owl which had nested up there, no doubt, through
many unswept winters and summers of Dover’s rule, and was now smoked out,
dazed and black from beating itself to exhaustion in the flue. It fell over the coals
and collapsed in a heap on the wooden floorboard with a clatter and a scuffle,
then lay like an emissary of the devil, hunched but breathing, wings stretched,
staring straight out at the boys through the soot that caked its eyes. There was no
one who was not frightened; even Spikely, a hero, was frightened. Except for

Jim, who had in a second folded the beast together and taken it out the door
without a word. They heard nothing, though they listened like stowaways, till the
sound of running water from down the corridor as Jim evidently washed his
hands. “He’s having a pee,” said Spikely, which earned a nervous laugh. But as
they filed out of the classroom they discovered the owl still folded, neatly dead
and awaiting burial, on top of the compost heap beside the Dip. Its neck, as the
braver ones established, was snapped. Only a gamekeeper, declared Sudeley,
who had one, would know how to kill an owl so well.

Among the rest of the Thursgood community, opinion regarding Jim was less
unanimous. The ghost of Mr. Maltby, the pianist, died hard. Matron, siding with
Bill Roach, pronounced him heroic and in need of care: it was a miracle he
managed with that back. Marjoribanks said he had been run over by a bus when
he was drunk. It was Marjoribanks also, at the staff match where Jim so excelled,
who pointed out the sweater. Marjoribanks was not a cricketer but he had
strolled down to watch with Thursgood.

“Do you think that sweater’s kosher,” he asked in a high, jokey voice, “or do
you think he pinched it?”

“Leonard, that’s very unfair,” Thursgood scolded, hammering at the flanks of
his Labrador. “Bite him, Ginny, bite the bad man.”

By the time he reached his study, however, Thursgood’s laughter had quite
worn off and he became extremely nervous. Bogus Oxford men he could deal
with, just as in his time he had known classics masters who had no Greek and
parsons who had no divinity. Such men, confronted with proof of their
deception, broke down and wept and left, or stayed on half-pay. But men who
withheld genuine accomplishment—these were a breed he had not met but he
knew already that he did not like them. Having consulted the university calendar,
he telephoned the agency—a Mr. Stroll, of the house of Stroll & Medley.

“What precisely do you want to know?” Mr. Stroll asked with a dreadful sigh.

“Well, nothing precisely. ” Thursgood’s mother was sewing at a sampler and
seemed not to hear. “Merely that if one asks for a written curriculum vitae one
likes it to be complete. One doesn’t like gaps. Not if one pays one’s fee.”

At this point Thursgood found himself wondering rather wildly whether he
had woken Mr. Stroll from a deep sleep to which he had now returned.

“Very patriotic bloke,” Mr. Stroll observed finally.

“I did not employ him for his patriotism.”

“He’s been in dock,” Mr. Stroll whispered on, as if through frightful draughts
of cigarette smoke. “Laid up. Spinal.”

“Quite so. But I assume he has not been in hospital for the whole of the last

twenty-five years. Touche, ” he murmured to his mother, his hand over the
mouthpiece, and once more it crossed his mind that Mr. Stroll had dropped off to
sleep.

“You’ve only got him till the end of term,” Mr. Stroll breathed. “If you don’t
fancy him, chuck him out. You asked for temporary, temporary’s what you’ve
got. You said cheap, you’ve got cheap.”

“That’s as may be,” Thursgood retorted gamely. “But I’ve paid you a twenty-
guinea fee; my father dealt with you for many years and I’m entitled to certain
assurances. You’ve put here—may 1 read it to you?—you’ve put here: 'Before
his injury, various overseas appointments of a commercial and prospecting
nature.’ Now that is hardly an enlightening description of a lifetime’s
employment, is it?”

At her sewing his mother nodded her agreement. “It is not, ” she echoed aloud.

“That’s my first point. Let me go on a little.”

“Not too much, darling,” warned his mother.

“1 happen to know he was up at Oxford in 1938. Why didn’t he finish? What
went wrong?”

“1 seem to recall there was an interlude round about then,” said Mr. Stroll after
another age. “But 1 expect you’re too young to remember it.”

“He can’t have been in prison all the time,” said his mother after a very long
silence, still without looking up from her sewing.

“He’s been somewhere,” said Thursgood morosely, staring across the
windswept gardens towards the Dip.

All through the summer holidays, as he moved uncomfortably between one
household and another, embracing and rejecting. Bill Roach fretted about Jim:
whether his back was hurting; what he was doing for money now that he had no
one to teach and only half a term’s pay to live on; worst of all, whether he would
be there when the new term began, for Bill had a feeling he could not describe
that Jim lived so precariously on the world’s surface that he might at any time
fall off it into a void; he feared that Jim was like himself, without a natural
gravity to hold him on. He rehearsed the circumstances of their first meeting,
and in particular Jim’s enquiry regarding friendship, and he had a holy terror that
just as he had failed his parents in love, so he had failed Jim, largely owing to the
disparity in their ages. And that therefore Jim had moved on and was already
looking somewhere else for a companion, scanning other schools with his pale
eyes. He imagined also that, like himself, Jim had had a great attachment that
had failed him and that he longed to replace. But here Bill Roach’s speculation

met a dead end: he had no idea how adults loved each other.

There was so little he could do that was practical. He consulted a medical
book and interrogated his mother about hunchbacks and he longed but did not
dare to steal a bottle of his father’s vodka and take it back to Thursgood’s as a
lure. And when at last his mother’s chauffeur dropped him at the hated steps, he
did not pause to say goodbye but ran for all he was worth to the top of the Dip,
and there to his immeasurable joy was Jim’s trailer in its same spot at the
bottom, a shade dirtier than before, and a fresh patch of earth beside it, he
supposed for winter vegetables. And Jim sitting on the step, grinning up at him
as if he had heard Bill coming and got the grin of welcome ready before he
appeared at the brink.

That same term, Jim invented a nickname for Roach. He dropped “Bill” and
called him “Jumbo” instead. He gave no reason for this and Roach, as is
common in the case of christenings, was in no position to object. In return.
Roach appointed himself Jim’s guardian; a regent-guardian was how he thought
of the appointment; a stand-in replacing Jim’s departed friend, whoever that
friend might be.

Unlike Jim Prideaux, Mr. George Smiley was not naturally equipped for
hurrying in the rain, least of all at dead of night. Indeed, he might have been the
final form for which Bill Roach was the prototype. Small, podgy, and at best
middle-aged, he was by appearance one of London’s meek who do not inherit
the earth. His legs were short, his gait anything but agile, his dress costly, ill-
fitting, and extremely wet. His overcoat, which had a hint of widowhood about
it, was of that black loose weave which is designed to retain moisture. Either the
sleeves were too long or his arms were too short, for, as with Roach, when he
wore his mackintosh, the cuffs all but concealed the fingers. For reasons of
vanity he wore no hat, believing rightly that hats made him ridiculous. “Like an
egg-cosy,” his beautiful wife had remarked not long before the last occasion on
which she left him, and her criticism, as so often, had endured. Therefore the
rain had formed in fat, unbanishable drops on the thick lenses of his spectacles,
forcing him alternately to lower or throw back his head as he scuttled along the
pavement that skirted the blackened arcades of Victoria Station. He was
proceeding west, to the sanctuary of Chelsea, where he lived. His step, for
whatever reason, was a fraction uncertain, and if Jim Prideaux had risen out of
the shadows demanding to know whether he had any friends, he would probably
have answered that he preferred to settle for a taxi.

“Roddy’s such a windbag,” he muttered to himself as a fresh deluge dashed
itself against his ample cheeks, then trickled downward to his sodden shirt.

“Why didn’t I just get up and leave?”

Ruefully, Smiley once more rehearsed the reasons for his present misery, and
concluded with a dispassion inseparable from the humble part of his nature that
they were of his own making.

It had been from the start a day of travail. He had risen too late after working
too late the night before, a practice that had crept up on him since retirement last
year. Discovering he had run out of coffee, he queued at the grocer’s till he ran
out of patience also, then haughtily decided to attend to his personal
administration. His bank statement, which had arrived with the morning’s post,
revealed that his wife had drawn the lion’s share of his monthly pension: very
well, he decreed, he would sell something. The response was irrational, for he
was quite decently off and the obscure City bank responsible for his pension paid
it with regularity. Wrapping up an early edition of Grimmelshausen,
nevertheless, a modest treasure from his Oxford days, he solemnly set off for

Heywood Hill’s bookshop in Curzon Street, where he occasionally contracted
friendly bargains with the proprietor. On the way he became even more irritable,
and from a call-box sought an appointment with his solicitor for that afternoon.

“George, how can you be so vulgar? Nobody divorces Ann. Send her flowers
and come to lunch.”

This advice bucked him up and he approached Heywood Hill with a merry
heart only to walk slap into the arms of Roddy Martindale emerging from
Trumper’s after his weekly haircut.

Martindale had no valid claim on Smiley either professionally or socially. He
worked on the fleshy side of the Foreign Office and his job consisted of lunching
visiting dignitaries whom no one else would have entertained in his woodshed.
He was a floating bachelor with a grey mane and that nimbleness which only fat
men have. He affected buttonholes and pale suits, and he pretended on the
flimsiest grounds to an intimate familiarity with the large back rooms of
Whitehall. Some years ago, before it was disbanded, he had adorned a Whitehall
working party to co-ordinate intelligence. In the war, having a certain
mathematical facility, he had also haunted the fringes of the secret world; and
once, as he never tired of telling, he had worked with John Landsbury on a
Circus coding operation of transient delicacy. But the war, as Smiley sometimes
had to remind himself, was thirty years ago.

“Hullo, Roddy,” said Smiley. “Nice to see you.”

Martindale spoke in a confiding upper-class bellow of the sort that, on foreign
holidays, had more than once caused Smiley to sign out of his hotel and run for
cover.

“My dear boy, if it isn’t the maestro himself! They told me you were locked
up with the monks in Saint Gallen or somewhere, poring over manuscripts!
Confess to me at once. I want to know all you’ve been doing, every little bit. Are
you well? Do you love England still? How’s the delicious Ann?” His restless
gaze flicked up and down the street before lighting on the wrapped volume of
Grimmelshausen under Smiley’s arm. “Pound to a penny that’s a present for her.
They tell me you spoil her outrageously.” His voice dropped to a mountainous
murmur: “I say, you’re not back on the beat, are you? Don’t tell me it’s all cover,
George, cover?” His sharp tongue explored the moist edges of his little mouth,
then, like a snake, vanished between its folds.

So, fool that he was, Smiley bought his escape by agreeing to dine that same
evening at a club in Manchester Square to which they both belonged but which
Smiley avoided like the pest, not least because Roddy Martindale was a member.
When evening came, he was still full of luncheon at the White Tower, where his
solicitor, a very self-indulgent man, had decided that only a great meal would

recover George from his doldrums. Martindale, by a different route, had reached
the same conclusion, and for four long hours over food Smiley did not want they
had bandied names as if they were forgotten footballers. Jebedee, who was
Smiley’s old tutor: “Such a loss to us, bless him,” murmured Martindale, who so
far as Smiley knew had never clapped eyes on Jebedee. “And what a talent for
the game, eh? One of the real greats, I always say.” Then Fielding, the French
mediaevalist from Cambridge: “Oh, but what a lovely sense of humour. Sharp
mind, sharp!” Then Sparke from the School of Oriental Languages, and lastly
Steed-Asprey, who had founded that very club in order to escape from bores like
Roddy Martindale.

“I knew his poor brother, you know. Half the mind and twice the brawn, bless
him. Brain went all the other way.”

And Smiley through a fog of drink had listened to this nonsense, saying “yes”
and “no” and “what a pity” and “no, they never found him,” and once, to his
abiding shame, “oh, come, you flatter me,” till with lugubrious inevitability
Martindale came to more recent things—the change of power and Smiley’s
withdrawal from the service.

Predictably, he started with the last days of Control: “Your old boss, George,
bless him, the only one who ever kept his name a secret. Not from you, of
course, he never had any secrets from you, George, did he? Close as thieves,
Smiley and Control were, so they say, right to the end.”

“They’re very complimentary.”

“Don’t flirt, George; I’m an old trooper, you forget. You and Control were just
like that.” Briefly the plump hands made a token marriage. “That’s why you
were thrown out—don’t deceive me, that’s why Bill Haydon got your job. That’s
why he’s Percy Alleline’s cup-bearer and you’re not.”

“If you say so, Roddy.”

“I do. I say more than that. Far more.”

As Martindale drew closer, Smiley caught the odour of one of Trumper’s most
sensitive creations.

“I say something else: Control never died at all. He’s been seen.” With a
fluttering gesture he silenced Smiley’s protests. “Let me finish. Willy
Andrewartha walked straight into him in Jo’burg airport, in the waiting-room.
Not a ghost. Flesh. Willy was at the bar buying a soda for the heat; you haven’t
seen Willy recently but he’s a balloon. He turned round, and there was Control
beside him dressed up like a ghastly Boer. The moment he saw Willy he bolted.
How’s that? So now we know. Control never died at all. He was driven out by
Percy Alleline and his three-piece band, so he went to ground in South Africa,

bless him. Well, you can’t blame him, can you? You can’t blame a man for
wanting a drop of peace in the evening of his life. I can’t.”

The monstrosity of this, reaching Smiley through a thickening wall of spiritual
exhaustion, left him momentarily speechless.

“That’s ridiculous! That’s the most idiotic story I ever heard! Control is dead.
He died of a heart attack after a long illness. Besides, he hated South Africa. He
hated everywhere except Surrey, the Circus, and Lords Cricket Ground. Really,
Roddy, you mustn’t tell stories like that.” He might have added: I buried him
myself at a hateful crematorium in the East End, last Christmas Eve, alone. The
parson had a speech impediment.

“Willy Andrewartha was always the most God-awful liar,” Martindale
reflected, quite unruffled. “I said the same to him myself: The sheerest
nonsense, Willy; you should be ashamed of yourself.’ ” And straight on, as if
never by thought or word had he subscribed to that silly view: “It was the Czech
scandal that put the final nail into Control’s coffin, I suppose. That poor fellow
who was shot in the back and got himself into the newspapers, the one who was
so thick with Bill Haydon always, so we hear. Ellis, we’re to call him, and we
still do, don’t we, even if we know his real name as well as we know our own.”

Shrewdly Martindale waited for Smiley to cap this, but Smiley had no
intention of capping anything, so Martindale tried a third tack.

“Somehow I can never quite believe in Percy Alleline as Chief, can you? Is it
age, George, or is it just my natural cynicism? Do tell me, you’re so good at
people. I suppose power sits poorly on those we’ve grown up with. Is that a
clue? There are so few who can carry it off for me these days and poor Percy’s
such an obvious person, I always think, specially after that little serpent. Control.
That heavy good fellowship—how can one take him seriously? One has only to
think of him in the old days lolling in the bar of the Travellers’, sucking away on
that log pipe of his and buying drinks for the moguls; well, really, one does like
one’s perfidy to be subtle, don’t you agree? Or don’t you care as long as it’s
successful? What’s his knack, George, what’s his secret recipe?” He was
speaking most intently, leaning forward, his eyes greedy and excited. Only food
could otherwise move him so deeply. “Living off the wits of his subordinates—
well, maybe that’s leadership these days.”

“Really, Roddy, I can’t help you,” said Smiley weakly. “I never knew Percy as
a force, you see. Only as a—” He lost the word.

“A striver,” Martindale suggested, eyes glistening. “With his sights on
Control’s purple, day and night. Now he’s wearing it and the mob loves him. So
who’s his strong left arm, George? Who’s earning him his reputation?
Wonderfully well he’s doing, we hear it from all sides. Little reading rooms at

the Admiralty, little committees popping up with funny names, red carpet for
Percy wherever he goes in the Whitehall corridors, junior ministers receiving
special words of congratulation from on high, people one’s never heard of
getting grand medals for nothing. I’ve seen it all before, you know.”

“Roddy, I can’t help you,” Smiley insisted, making to get up. “You’re out of
my depth, truly.” But Martindale was physically restraining him, holding him at
the table with one damp hand while he talked still faster.

“So who’s the cleverboots? Not Percy, that’s for sure. And don’t tell me the
Americans have started trusting us again, either.” The grip tightened. “Dashing
Bill Haydon, our latter-day Lawrence of Arabia, bless him; there you are—it’s
Bill, your old rival.” Martindale’s tongue poked out its head again, reconnoitred
and withdrew, leaving a thin smile like a trail. “I’m told that you and Bill shared
everything once upon a time,” he said. “Still, he never was orthodox, was he?
Genius never is.”

“Anything further you require, Mr. Smiley?” the waiter asked.

“Then it’s Bland: the shop-soiled white hope, the redbrick don.” Still he would
not release him. “And if those two aren’t providing the speed, it’s someone in
retirement, isn’t it? I mean someone pretending to be in retirement, don’t I? And
if Control’s dead, who is there left? Apart from you.”

They were putting on their coats. The porters had gone home; they had to
fetch them for themselves from the empty brown racks.

“Roy Bland’s not redbrick,” Smiley said loudly. “He was at Saint Antony’s
College, Oxford, if you want to know.”

Heaven help me, it was the best I could do, thought Smiley.

“Don’t be silly, dear,” Martindale snapped. Smiley had bored him: he looked
sulky and cheated; distressing downward folds had formed on the lower contours
of his cheeks. “Of course Saint Antony’s is redbrick; it makes no difference
there’s a little bit of sandstone in the same street, even if he was your protege. I
expect he’s Bill Haydon’s now—don’t tip him, it’s my party, not yours. Father to
them all. Bill is—always was. Draws them like bees. Well, he has the glamour,
hasn’t he; not like some of us. Star quality I call it, one of the few. I’m told the
women literally bow down before him, if that’s what women do.”

“Good night, Roddy.”

“Love to Ann, mind.”

“I won’t forget.”

“Well, don’t.”

And now it was pouring with rain, Smiley was soaked to the skin, and God as
a punishment had removed all taxis from the face of London.

“Sheer lack of will-power,” he told himself as he courteously declined the
suggestions of a lady in a doorway. “One calls it politeness, whereas in fact it is
nothing but weakness. You featherhead, Martindale. You pompous, bogus,
effeminate, nonproductive—” He stepped widely to avoid an unseen obstacle.
“Weakness,” he resumed, “and an inability to live a self-sufficient life
independent of institutions”—a puddle emptied itself neatly into his shoe—“and
emotional attachments that have long outlived their purpose. Viz., my wife; viz.,
the Circus; viz., living in London. Taxi!”

Smiley lurched forward but was already too late. Two girls, giggling under
one umbrella, clambered aboard in a flurry of arms and legs. Uselessly pulling
up the collar of his black overcoat, he continued his solitary march. “Shop-soiled
white hope,” he muttered furiously. “Little bit of sandstone in the street. You
bombastic, inquisitive, impertinent—”

And then, of course, he remembered far too late that he had left the
Grimmelshausen at his club.

“Oh, damn!” he cried sopra voce, halting in his tracks for greater emphasis.
“Oh, damn—oh, damn —oh, damn.”

He would sell his London house: he had decided. Back there under the
awning, crouching beside the cigarette machine, waiting for the cloudburst to
end, he had taken this grave decision. Property values in London had risen out of
proportion; he had heard it from every side. Good. He would sell and with a part
of the proceeds buy a cottage in the Cotswolds. Burford? Too much traffic.
Steeple Aston—that was a place. He would set up as a mild eccentric, discursive,
withdrawn, but possessing one or two lovable habits such as muttering to
himself as he bumbled along pavements. Out of date, perhaps, but who wasn’t
these days? Out of date, but loyal to his own time. At a certain moment, after all,
every man chooses: will he go forward, will he go back? There was nothing
dishonourable in not being blown about by every little modern wind. Better to
have worth, to entrench, to be an oak of one’s own generation. And if Ann
wanted to return—well, he would show her the door.

Or not show her the door, according to—well, how much she wanted to return.

Gonsoled by these visions, Smiley arrived at the King’s Road, where he
paused on the pavement as if waiting to cross. To either side, festive boutiques.
Before him, his own Bywater Street, a cul-de-sac exactly 117 of his own paces
long. When he had first come to live here, these Georgian cottages had a modest.

down-at-heel charm, with young couples making do on fifteen pounds a week
and a tax-free lodger hidden in the basement. Now steel screens protected their
lower windows, and for each house three cars jammed the curb. From long habit,
Smiley passed these in review, checking which were familiar, which were not; of
the unfamiliar, which had aerials and extra mirrors, which were the closed vans
that watchers like. Partly he did this as a test of memory to preserve his mind
from the atrophy of retirement, just as on other days he learnt the names of the
shops along his bus route to the British Museum; just as he knew how many
stairs there were to each flight of his own house and which way each of the
twelve doors opened.

But Smiley had a second reason, which was fear, the secret fear that follows
every professional to his grave. Namely, that one day, out of a past so complex
that he himself could not remember all the enemies he might have made, one of
them would find him and demand the reckoning.

At the bottom of the street, a neighbour was exercising her dog; seeing him,
she lifted her head to say something, but he ignored her, knowing it would be
about Ann. He crossed the road. His house was in darkness; the curtains were as
he had left them. He climbed the six steps to the front door. Since Ann’s
departure, his cleaning woman had also left: no one but Ann had a key. There
were two locks, a Banham deadlock and a Chubb Pipekey, and two splinters of
his own manufacture, splits of oak each the size of a thumbnail, wedged into the
lintel above and below the Banham. They were a hangover from his days in the
field. Recently, without quite knowing why, he had started using them again;
perhaps he didn’t want her to take him by surprise. With the tips of his fingers he
discovered each in turn. The routine over, he unlocked the door, pushed it open,
and felt the midday mail slithering over the carpet.

What was due? he wondered. German Life and Letters? Philology? Philology,
he decided; it was already overdue. Putting on the hall light, he stooped and
peered through his post. One “account rendered” from his tailor for a suit he had
not ordered but that he suspected was one of those presently adorning Ann’s
lover; one bill from a garage in Henley for her petrol (what, pray, were they
doing in Henley, broke, on the ninth of October?); one letter from the bank
regarding a local cashing facility in favour of the Lady Ann Smiley at a branch
of the Midland Bank in Immingham.

And what the devil, he demanded of this document, are they doing in
Immingham? Who ever had a love affair in Immingham, for goodness’ sake?
Where was Immingham?

He was still pondering the question when his gaze fell upon an unfamiliar
umbrella in the stand, a silk one with a stitched leather handle and a gold ring

with no initial. And it passed through his mind with a speed which has no place
in time that since the umbrella was dry it must have arrived there before six-
fifteen when the rain began, for there was no moisture in the stand either. Also
that it was an elegant umbrella and the ferrule was barely scratched, though it
was not new. And that therefore the umbrella belonged to someone agile—even
young, like Ann’s latest swain. But that since its owner had known about the
wedges and known how to put them back once he was inside the house, and had
the wit to lay the mail against the door after disturbing and no doubt reading it,
then most likely he knew Smiley, too; and was not a lover but a professional like
himself, who had at some time worked closely with him and knew his
handwriting, as it is called in the jargon.

The drawing-room door was ajar. Softly he pushed it further open.

“Peter?” he said.

Through the gap he saw by the light of the street two suede shoes, lazily
folded, protruding from one end of the sofa.

“I’d leave that coat on if I were you, George, old boy,” said an amiable voice.
“We’ve got a long way to go.”

Five minutes later, dressed in a vast brown travelling coat, a gift from Ann and
the only one he had that was dry, George Smiley was sitting crossly in the
passenger seat of Peter Guillam’s extremely draughty sports car, which he had
parked in an adjoining square. Their destination was Ascot, a place famous for
women and horses. And less famous, perhaps, as the residence of Mr. Oliver
Lacon, of the Gabinet Office, a senior adviser to various mixed committees and a
watchdog of intelligence affairs. Or, as Guillam had it less reverentially,
Whitehall’s head prefect.

While, at Thursgood’s school, wakefully in bed. Bill Roach was contemplating
the latest wonders that had befallen him in the course of his daily vigil over
Jim’s welfare. Yesterday Jim had amazed Latzy. Thursday he had stolen Miss
Aaronson’s mail. Miss Aaronson taught violin and scripture; Roach courted her
for her tenderness. Latzy, the assistant gardener, was a D.P., said Matron, and
D.P.s spoke no English, or very little. D.P. meant Different Person, said Matron,
or anyway, foreign from the war. But yesterday Jim had spoken to Latzy, seeking
his assistance with the car club, and he had spoken to him in D.P., or whatever
D.P.s speak, and Latzy had grown a foot taller on the spot.

The matter of Miss Aaronson’s mail was more complex. There were two
envelopes on the staffroom sideboard Thursday morning after chapel when
Roach called for his form’s exercise books, one addressed to Jim and one to
Miss Aaronson. Jim’s was typewritten. Miss Aaronson’s was handwritten, in a

hand not unlike Jim’s own. The staffroom, while Roach made these
observations, was empty. He helped himself to the exercise books and was
quietly taking his leave when Jim walked in by the other door, red and blowing
from his early walk.

“On your way, Jumbo, bell’s gone,” stooping over the sideboard.

“Yes, sir.”

“Foxy weather, eh, Jumbo?”

“Yes, sir.”

“On your way, then.”

At the door. Roach looked round. Jim was standing again, leaning back to
open the morning’s Daily Telegraph. The sideboard was empty. Both envelopes
had gone.

Had Jim written to Miss Aaronson and changed his mind? Proposing
marriage, perhaps? Another thought came to Bill Roach. Recently, Jim had
acquired an old typewriter, a wrecked Remington that he had put right with his
own hands. Had he typed his own letter on it? Was he so lonely that he wrote
himself letters, and stole other people’s as well? Roach fell asleep.

Guillam drove languidly but fast. Smells of autumn filled the car, a full moon
was shining, strands of mist hung over open fields, and the cold was irresistible.
Smiley wondered how old Guillam was and guessed forty, but in that light he
could have been an undergraduate sculling on the river; he moved the gear lever
with a long flowing movement as if he were passing it through water. In any
case, Smiley reflected irritably, the car was far too young, for Guillam. They had
raced through Runnymede and begun the run up Egham Hill. They had been
driving for twenty minutes and Smiley had asked a dozen questions and received
no answer worth a penny, and now a nagging fear was waking in him that he
refused to name.

“Tm surprised they didn’t throw you out with the rest of us,” he said, not very
pleasantly, as he hauled the skirts of his coat more tightly round him. “You had
all the qualifications: good at your work, loyal, discreet.”

“They put me in charge of scalp-hunters.”

“Oh, my Lord,” said Smiley with a shudder, and, pulling up his collar round
his ample chins, he abandoned himself to that memory in place of others more
disturbing: Brixton, and the grim flint schoolhouse that served the scalp-hunters
as their headquarters. The scalp-hunters’ official name was Travel. They had
been formed by Gontrol on Bill Haydon’s suggestion in the pioneer days of the
cold war, when murder and kidnapping and crash blackmail were common
currency, and their first commandant was Haydon’s nominee. They were a small
outfit, about a dozen men, and they were there to handle the hit-and-run jobs that
were too dirty or too risky for the residents abroad. Good intelligence work,
Gontrol had always preached, was gradual and rested on a kind of gentleness.
The scalp-hunters were the exception to his own rule. They weren’t gradual and
they weren’t gentle either, thus reflecting Haydon’s temperament rather than
GontroTs. And they worked solo, which was why they were stabled out of sight
behind a flint wall with broken glass and barbed wire on the top.

“I asked whether 'lateralism’ was a word to you.”

“It most certainly is not.”

“It’s the Tn’ doctrine. We used to go up and down. Now we go along.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“In your day, the Gircus ran itself by regions. Africa, satellites, Russia, Ghina,
South East Asia, you name it: each region was commanded by its own juju man;
Gontrol sat in heaven and held the strings. Remember?”

“It strikes a distant chord.”

“Well, today everything operational is under one hat. It’s called London
Station. Regions are out, lateralism is in. Bill Haydon’s Commander London
Station, Roy Bland’s his number two, Toby Esterhase runs between them like a
poodle. They’re a service within a service. They share their own secrets and
don’t mix with the proles. It makes us more secure.”

“It sounds a very good idea,” said Smiley, studiously ignoring the innuendo.

As the memories once more began seething upward into his conscious mind,
an extraordinary feeling passed over him: that he was living the day twice, first
with Martindale in the club, now again with Guillam in a dream. They passed a
plantation of young pine trees. The moonlight lay in strips between them.

Smiley began, “Is there any word of—” Then he asked, in a more tentative
tone, “What’s the news of Ellis?”

“In quarantine,” said Guillam tersely.

“Oh, I’m sure. Of course. I don’t mean to pry. Merely, can he get around and
so on? He did recover; he can walk? Backs can be terribly tricky, I understand.”

“The word says he manages pretty well. How’s Ann, I didn’t ask.”

“Fine. Just fine.”

It was pitch dark inside the car. They had turned off the road and were passing
over gravel. Black walls of foliage rose to either side, lights appeared, then a
high porch, and the steepled outline of a rambling house lifted above the
treetops. The rain had stopped, but as Smiley stepped into the fresh air he heard
all round him the restless ticking of wet leaves.

Yes, he thought, it was raining when I came here before, when the name Jim
Ellis was headline news.

They had washed and, in the lofty cloakroom, inspected Eacon’s climbing kit
mawkishly dumped on the Sheraton chest of drawers. Now they sat in a half¬
circle facing one empty chair. It was the ugliest house for miles around and
Eacon had picked it up for a song. “A Berkshire Gamelot,” he had once called it,
explaining it away to Smiley, “built by a teetotal millionaire.” The drawing-room
was a great hall with stained-glass windows twenty feet high and a pine gallery
over the entrance. Smiley counted off the familiar things: an upright piano
littered with musical scores, old portraits of clerics in gowns, a wad of printed
invitations. He looked for the Gambridge University oar and found it slung over
the fireplace. The same fire was burning, too mean for the enormous grate. An
air of need prevailing over wealth.

“Are you enjoying retirement, George?” Eacon asked, as if blurting into the
ear trumpet of a deaf aunt. “You don’t miss the warmth of human contact? I

rather would, I think. One’s work, one’s old buddies.”

He was a string bean of a man, graceless and boyish: church and spy
establishment, said Haydon, the Circus wit. His father was a dignitary of the
Scottish church and his mother something noble. Occasionally the smarter
Sundays wrote about him, calling him “new-style” because he was young. The
skin of his face was clawed from hasty shaving.

“Oh, 1 think 1 manage very well, really, thank you,” said Smiley politely. And
to draw it out: “Yes. Yes, I’m sure I do. And you? All goes well with you?”

“No big changes, no. All very smooth. Charlotte got her scholarship to
Roedean, which was nice.”

“Oh, good.”

“And your wife, she’s in the pink and so on?”

His expressions were also boyish.

“Very bonny, thank you,” said Smiley, trying gallantly to respond in kind.

They were watching the double doors. From far off they heard the jangle of
footsteps on a ceramic floor. Smiley guessed two people, both men. The doors
opened and a tall figure appeared half in silhouette. For the fraction of a
moment, Smiley glimpsed a second man behind him, dark, small, and attentive;
but only the one man stepped into the room before the doors were closed by
unseen hands.

“Lock us in, please,” Lacon called, and they heard the snap of the key. “You
know Smiley, don’t you?”

“Yes, I think I do,” said the figure as he began the long walk towards them out
of the far gloom. “I think he once gave me a job, didn’t you, Mr. Smiley?”

His voice was as soft as a southerner’s drawl, but there was no mistaking the
colonial accent. “Tarr, sir. Ricki Tarr from Penang.”

A fragment of firelight illuminated one side of the stark smile and made a
hollow of one eye. “The lawyer’s boy, remember? Come on, Mr. Smiley, you
changed my first nappies.”

And then, absurdly, they were all four standing, and Guillam and Lacon
looked on like godparents while Tarr shook Smiley’s hand once, then again, then
once more for the photographs.

“How are you, Mr. Smiley? It’s real nice to see you, sir.”

Relinquishing Smiley’s hand at last, he swung away in the direction of his
appointed chair, while Smiley thought. Yes, with Ricki Tarr it could have
happened. With Tarr, anything could have happened. My God, he thought; two
hours ago I was telling myself I would take refuge in the past. He felt thirsty, and
supposed it was fear.

Ten? Twelve years ago? It was not his night for understanding time. Among
Smiley’s jobs in those days was the vetting of recruits: no one taken on without
his nod, no one trained without his signature on the schedule. The cold war was
running high, scalp-hunters were in demand, the Circus’s residencies abroad had
been ordered by Haydon to look out for likely material. Steve Mackelvore from
Djakarta came up with Tarr. Mackelvore was an old pro with cover as a shipping
agent, and he had found Tarr angry drunk, kicking round the docks looking for a
girl called Rose, who had walked out on him.

According to Tarr’s story, he was mixed up with a bunch of Belgians running
guns between the islands and up-coast. He disliked Belgians and he was bored
with gunrunning and he was angry because they’d stolen Rose. Mackelvore
reckoned he would respond to discipline and was young enough to train for the
type of mailfist operation that the scalp-hunters undertook from behind the walls
of their glum Brixton schoolhouse. After the usual searches, Tarr was forwarded
to Singapore for a second look, then to the Nursery at Sarratt for a third. At that
point Smiley came into the act as moderator at a succession of interviews, some
hostile. Sarratt Nursery was the training compound, but it had space for other
uses.

Tarr’s father was an Australian solicitor living in Penang, it seemed. The
mother was a small-time actress from Bradford who came East with a British
drama group before the war. The father, Smiley recalled, had an evangelical
streak and preached in local gospel halls. The mother had a small criminal record
in England, but Tarr’s father either didn’t know or didn’t care. When the war
came, the couple evacuated to Singapore for the sake of their young son. A few
months later, Singapore fell and Ricki Tarr began his education in Changi jail
under Japanese supervision. In Changi the father preached God’s charity to
everyone in sight, and if the Japs hadn’t persecuted him his fellow prisoners
would have done the job for them. With Liberation, the three of them went back
to Penang. Ricki tried to read for the law but more often broke it, and the father
turned some rough preachers loose on him to beat the sin out of his soul. Tarr
flew the coop to Borneo. At eighteen he was a fully paid-up gunrunner playing
all seven ends against the middle around the Indonesian islands, and that was
how Mackelvore stumbled on him.

By the time he had graduated from the Nursery, the Malayan emergency had
broken. Tarr was played back into gunrunning. Almost the first people he
bumped into were his old Belgian friends. They were too busy supplying guns to
the Communists to bother where he had been, and they were shorthanded. Tarr
ran a few shipments for them in order to blow their contacts, then one night got
them drunk, shot four of them, including Rose, and set fire to their boat. He hung

around Malaya and did a couple more jobs before being called back to Brixton
and refitted for special operations in Kenya—or, in less sophisticated language,
hunting Mau Mau for bounty.

After Kenya, Smiley pretty much lost sight of him, but a couple of incidents
stuck in his memory because they might have become scandals and Control had
to be informed. In 1964, Tarr was sent to Brazil to make a crash offer of a bribe
to an armaments minister known to be in deep water. Tarr was too rough; the
minister panicked and told the press. Tarr had Dutch cover and no one was wiser
except Netherlands intelligence, who were furious. In Spain a year later, acting
on a tip-off supplied by Bill Haydon, Tarr blackmailed—or burned, as the scalp-
hunters would say—a Polish diplomat who had lost his heart to a dancer. The
first yield was good; Tarr won a commendation and a bonus. But when he went
back for a second helping the Pole wrote a confession to his ambassador and
threw himself, with or without encouragement, from a high window.

In Brixton, they used to call him accident-prone. Guillam, by the expression
on his immature but aging face, as they sat in their half-circle round the meagre
fire, called him a lot worse than that.

“Well, I guess Td better make my pitch,” Tarr said pleasantly as he settled his
easy body into the chair.

“It happened around six months ago,” Tarr began.

“April,” Guillam snapped. “Just keep it precise, shall we, all the way along?”

“April, then,” Tarr said equably. “Things were pretty quiet in Brixton. I guess
there must have been half a dozen of us on standby. Pete Sembrini, he was in
from Rome; Cy Vanhofer had just made a hit in Budapest”—he gave a
mischievous smile—“Ping-Pong and snooker in the Brixton waiting room.
Right, Mr. Guillam?”

“It was the silly season.”

When out of the blue, said Tarr, came a flash requisition from Hong Kong
residency.

“They had a low-grade Soviet trade delegation in town, chasing up electrical
goods for the Moscow market. One of the delegates was stepping wide in the
nightclubs. Name of Boris; Mr. Guillam has the details. No previous record.
They’d had the tabs on him for five days, and the delegation was booked in for
fourteen more. Politically it was too hot for the local boys to handle but they
reckoned a crash approach might do the trick. The yield didn’t look that special,
but so what? Maybe we’d just buy him for stock—right, Mr. Guillam?”

Stock meant sale or exchange with another intelligence service: a commerce
in small-time defectors handled by the scalp-hunters.

Ignoring Tarr, Guillam said, “South East Asia was Tarr’s parish. He was
sitting around with nothing to do, so I ordered him to make a site inspection and
report back by cable.”

Each time someone else spoke, Tarr sank into a dream. His gaze settled upon
the speaker, a mistiness entered his eyes, and there was a pause like a coming
back before he began again.

“So I did what Mr. Guillam ordered,” he said. “I always do, don’t I, Mr.
Guillam? I’m a good boy really, even if I am impulsive.”

He flew the next night—Saturday, March 31st—with an Australian passport
describing him as a car salesman and with two virgin Swiss escape passports
hidden in the lining of his suitcase. These were contingency documents to be
filled in as circumstances demanded: one for Boris, one for himself. He made a
car rendezvous with the Hong Kong resident not far from his hotel, the Golden
Gate on Kowloon.

Here Guillam leaned over to Smiley and murmured, “Tufty Thesinger,
buffoon. Ex-major, King’s African Rifles. Percy Alleline’s appointment.”

Thesinger produced a report on Boris’s movements based on one week’s
surveillance.

“Boris was a real oddball,” Tarr said. “I couldn’t make him out. He’d been
boozing every night without a break. He hadn’t slept for a week and Thesinger’s
watchers were folding at the knees. All day he trailed round after the delegation,
inspecting factories, chiming in at discussions, and being the bright young Soviet
official.”

“How young?” Smiley asked.

Guillam threw in: “His visa application gave him born Minsk 1946.”

“Evening time, he’d go back to the Alexandra Lodge, an old shanty house out
on North Point where the delegation had holed out. He’d eat with the crew; then
around nine he’d ease out the side entrance, grab a taxi, and belt down to the
mainline night spots around Pedder Street. His favourite haunt was the Cat’s
Cradle in Queen’s Road, where he bought drinks for local businessmen and
acted like Mr. Personality. He might stay there till midnight. From the Cradle he
cut right down to Aberdeen Harbour, a place called Angelika’s, where the drink
was cheaper. Alone. It’s mainly floating restaurants and the big spenders down
there, but Angelika’s is a landbound cafe with a hellhole in the basement. He’d
have three or four drinks and keep the receipts. Mainly he drank brandy but now
and then he’d have a vodka to vary his diet. He’d had one tangle with a Eurasian
girl along the way, and Thesinger’s watchers got after her and bought the story.
She said he was lonely and sat on the bed moaning about his wife for not
appreciating his genius. That was a real breakthrough,” he added sarcastically as
Lacon noisily swooped on the little fire and stirred it, one coal against the other,
into life. “That night I went down to the Cradle and took a look at him.
Thesinger’s watchers had been sent to bed with a glass of milk. They didn’t want
to know.”

Sometimes as Tarr spoke, an extraordinary stillness came over his body, as if
he were hearing his own voice played back to him.

“He arrived ten minutes after me and he brought his own company, a big
blond Swede with a Chinese broad in tow. It was dark, so I moved into a table
nearby. They ordered Scotch, Boris paid, and I sat six feet away watching the
lousy band and listening to their conversation. The Chinese kid kept her mouth
shut and the Swede was doing most of the running. They talked English. The
Swede asked Boris where he was staying, and Boris said the Excelsior, which
was a damn lie because he was staying at the Alexandra Lodge with the rest of
the church outing. All right, the Alexandra is down the list; the Excelsior sounds
better. About midnight the party breaks up. Boris says he’s got to go home and
tomorrow’s a busy day. That was the second lie, because he was no more going

home than—what’s the one, Jekyll and Hyde, right!—the regular doctor who
dressed up and went on the razzle. So Boris was who?”

For a moment no one helped him.

“Hyde,” said Lacon to his scrubbed red hands. Sitting again, he had clasped
them on his lap.

“Hyde,” Tarr repeated. “Thank you, Mr. Lacon; I always saw you as a literary
man. So they settle the bill and I traipse down to Aberdeen to be there ahead of
him when he hits Angelika’s. By this time I’m pretty sure I’m in the wrong ball
game.”

On dry long fingers, Tarr studiously counted off the reasons: first, he never
knew a Soviet delegation that didn’t carry a couple of security gorillas whose job
was to keep the boys out of the fleshpots. So how did Boris slip the leash night
after night? Second, he didn’t like the way Boris pushed his foreign currency
around. For a Soviet official, that was against nature, he insisted: “He just
doesn’t have any damn currency. If he does, he buys beads for his squaw. And
three, I didn’t like the way he lied. He was a sight too glib for decency.”

So Tarr waited at the Angelika, and sure enough half an hour later his Mr.
Hyde turned up all on his own. “He sits down and calls for a drink. That’s all he
does. Sits and drinks like a damn wallflower!”

Once more it was Smiley’s turn to receive the heat of Tarr’s charm: “So what’s
it all about, Mr. Smiley? See what I mean? It’s little things I’m noticing,” he
confided, still to Smiley. “Just take the way he sat. Believe me, sir, if we’d been
in that place ourselves we couldn’t have sat better than Boris. He had the pick of
the exits and the stairway; he had a fine view of the main entrance and the
action; he was right-handed and he was covered by a left-hand wall. Boris was a
professional, Mr. Smiley; there was no doubt of it whatsoever. He was waiting
for a connect, working a letter-box, maybe, or trailing his coat and looking for a
pass from a mug like me. Well, now listen: it’s one thing to burn a small-time
trade delegate. It’s quite a different ball game to swing your legs at a Centre-
trained hood—right, Mr. Guillam?”

Guillam said, “Since the reorganisation, scalp-hunters have no brief to trawl
for double agents. They must be turned over to London Station on sight. The
boys have a standing order, over Bill Haydon’s own signature. If there’s even a
smell of the opposition, abandon.” He added, for Smiley’s special ear, “Under
lateralism our autonomy is cut to the bone.”

“And I’ve been in double-double games before,” Tarr confessed in a tone of
injured virtue. “Believe me, Mr. Smiley, they are a can of worms.”

“I’m sure they are,” said Smiley, and gave a prim tug at his spectacles.

Tarr cabled Guillam “no sale,” booked a flight home, and went shopping.

However, since his flight didn’t leave till Thursday, he thought that before he
left, just to pay his fare, he might as well burgle Boris’s room.

“The Alexandra’s a real ramshackle old place, Mr. Smiley, off Marble Road,
with a stack of wooden balconies. As for the locks—why, sir, they give up when
they see you coming.”

In a very short time, therefore, Tarr was standing inside Boris’s room with his
back against the door, waiting for his eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. He
was still standing there when a woman spoke to him in Russian drowsily from
the bed.

“It was Boris’s wife,” Tarr explained. “She was crying. Look, I’ll call her
Irina, right? Mr. Guillam has the details.”

Smiley was already objecting: wife was impossible, he said. Centre would
never let them both out of Russia at the same time; they’d keep one and send the
other—

“Common-law marriage,” Guillam said dryly. “Unofficial but permanent.”

“There’s a lot that are the other way round these days,” said Tarr with a sharp
grin at no one, least of all Smiley, and Guillam shot him another foul look.

6

From the outset of this meeting, Smiley had assumed for the main a Buddha-like
inscrutability from which neither Tarr’s story nor the rare interjections of Lacon
and Guillam could rouse him. He sat leaning back with his short legs bent, head
forward, and plump hands linked across his generous stomach. His hooded eyes
had closed behind the thick lenses. His only fidget was to polish his glasses on
the silk lining of his tie, and when he did this his eyes had a soaked, naked look
that was embarrassing to those who caught him at it. His interjection, however,
and the donnish, inane sound that followed Guillam’s explanation, now acted
like a signal upon the rest of the gathering, bringing a shuffling of chairs and a
clearing of throats.

Lacon was foremost: “George, what are your drinking habits? Gan I get you a
Scotch or anything?” He offered drink solicitously, like aspirin for a headache. “I
forgot to say it earlier,” he explained. “George, a bracer: come. It’s winter, after
all. A nip of something?”

“I’m fine, thank you,” Smiley said.

He would have liked a little coffee from the percolator but somehow he didn’t
feel able to ask. Also he remembered it was terrible.

“Guillam?” Lacon proceeded. No; Guillam also found it impossible to accept
alcohol from Lacon.

He didn’t offer anything to Tarr, who went straight on with his narrative.

Tarr took Irina’s presence calmly, he said. He had worked up his fallback
before he entered the building, and now he went straight into his act. He didn’t
pull a gun or slap his hand over her mouth or any of that tripe, as he put it, but he
said he had come to speak to Boris on a private matter; he was sorry and he was
damn well going to sit there till Boris showed up. In good Australian, as became
an outraged car salesman from down under, he explained that while he didn’t
want to barge into anyone’s business he was damned if he was going to have his
girl and his money stolen in a single night by a lousy Russian who couldn’t pay
for his pleasures. He worked up a lot of outrage but managed to keep his voice
down, and then he waited to see what she did.

And that, said Tarr, was how it all began.

It was eleven-thirty when he made Boris’s room. He left at one-thirty with a
promise of a meeting next night. By then the situation was all the other way:

“We weren’t doing anything improper, mind. Just pen friends—right, Mr.
Smiley?”

For a moment, that bland sneer seemed to lay claim to Smiley’s most precious
secrets.

“Right,” he assented vapidly.

There was nothing exotic about Irina’s presence in Hong Kong and no reason
why Thesinger should have known of it, Tarr explained. Irina was a member of
the delegation in her own right. She was a trained textile buyer: “Come to think
of it, she was a sight better qualified than her old man, if I can call him that. She
was a plain kid, a bit blue-stocking for my taste, but she was young and she had
one hell of a pretty smile when she stopped crying.” Tarr coloured quaintly. “She
was good company,” he insisted, as if arguing against a trend. “When Mr.
Thomas from Adelaide came into her life, she was at the end of the line from
worrying what to do about the demon Boris. She thought I was the Angel
Gabriel. Who could she talk to about her husband who wouldn’t turn the dogs on
him? She’d no chums on the delegation; she’d no one she trusted even back in
Moscow, she said. Nobody who hadn’t been through it would ever know what it
was like trying to keep a ruined relationship going while all the time you’re on
the move.” Smiley was once more in a deep trance. “Hotel after hotel, city after
city, not even allowed to speak to the natives in a natural way or get a smile from
a stranger—that’s how she described her life. She reckoned it was a pretty
miserable state of affairs, Mr. Smiley, and there was a lot of God-thumping and
an empty vodka bottle beside the bed to show for it. Why couldn’t she be like
normal people? she kept saying. Why couldn’t she enjoy the Lord’s sunshine like
the rest of us? She loved sightseeing, she loved foreign kids; why couldn’t she
have a kid of her own? A kid born free, not in captivity. She kept saying that:
bom in captivity, born free. T’m a jolly person, Thomas. I’m a normal, sociable
girl. I like people: why should I deceive them when I like them?’ And then she
said, the trouble was that long ago she had been chosen for work that made her
frozen like an old woman and cut her off from God. So that’s why she’d had a
drink and why she was having a cry. She’d kind of forgotten her husband by
then; she was apologising for having a fling, more.” Again he faltered. “I could
scent it, Mr. Smiley. There was gold in her. I could scent it from the start.
Knowledge is power, they say, sir, and Irina had the power, same as she had the
quality. She was hellbent maybe, but she could still give her all. I can sense
generosity in a woman where I meet it, Mr. Smiley. I have a talent for it. And
this lady was generous. Jesus, how do you describe a hunch? Some people can
smell water under the ground ...”

He seemed to expect some show of sympathy, so Smiley said, “I understand,”
and plucked at the lobe of his ear.

Watching him with a strange dependence in his expression, Tarr kept silent a

stretch longer. “First thing next morning, I cancelled my flight and changed my
hotel,” he said finally.

Abruptly Smiley opened his eyes wide. “What did you tell London?”

“Nothing.”

“Why not?”

“Because he’s a devious fool,” said Guillam.

“Maybe I thought Mr. Guillam would say, 'Gome home, Tarr,”’ he replied,
with a knowing glance at Guillam that was not returned. “You see, long ago
when I was a little boy I made a mistake and walked into a honey trap.”

“He made an ass of himself with a Polish girl,” said Guillam.

“He sensed her generosity, too.”

“I knew Irina was no honey trap, but how could I expect Mr. Guillam to
believe me? No way.”

“Did you tell Thesinger?”

“Hell, no.”

“What reason did you give London for postponing your flight?”

“I was due to fly Thursday. I reckoned no one back home would miss me till
Tuesday. Specially with Boris being a dead duck.”

“He didn’t give a reason and the housekeepers posted him absent without
leave on the Monday,” said Guillam. “He broke every rule in the book. And
some that aren’t. By the middle of that week, even Bill Haydon was beating his
war drums. And I was having to listen,” he added tartly.

However that was, Tarr and Irina met next evening. They met again the
evening after that. The first meeting was in a cafe and it limped. They took a lot
of care not to be seen, because Irina was frightened stiff not just of her husband
but of the security guards attached to the delegation—the gorillas, as Tarr called
them. She refused a drink and she was shaking. The second evening Tarr was
still waiting on her generosity. They took the tram up to Victoria Peak, jammed
between American matrons in white socks and eyeshades. The third he hired a
car and drove her round the New Territories till she suddenly got the heebies
about being so close to the Ghinese border, so they had to run for harbour.
Nevertheless she loved that trip, and often spoke of the tidy beauty of it, the fish
ponds and the paddy fields. Tarr also liked the trip because it proved to both of
them that they weren’t being watched. But Irina had still not unpacked, as he put
it.

“Now I’ll tell you a damn odd thing about this stage of the game. At the start,

I worked Thomas the Aussie to death. I fed her a lot of smoke about a sheep
station outside Adelaide and a big property in the high street with a glass front
and 'Thomas’ in lights. She didn’t believe me. She nodded and fooled around

and waited till I’d said my piece; then she said, 'Yes, Thomas,’ 'No, Thomas,’
and changed the subject.”

On the fourth evening, he drove her into the hills overlooking North Shore,
and Irina told Tarr that she had fallen in love with him and that she was
employed by Moscow Centre, she and her husband both, and that she knew Tarr
was in the trade, too; she could tell by his alertness and the way he listened with
his eyes.

“She’d decided I was an English colonel of intelligence,” said Tarr with no
smile at all. “She was crying one minute and laughing the next, and in my
opinion she was three-quarters of the way to being a basket case. Half, she talked
like a pocket-book loony heroine, half like a nice up-and-down suburban kid.

The English were her favourite people. Gentlemen, she kept saying. I’d brought
her a bottle of vodka and she drank half of it in about fifteen seconds flat.

Hooray for English gentlemen. Boris was the lead and Irina was the backup girl.
It was a his-and-hers act, and one day she’d talk to Percy Alleline and tell him a
great secret all for himself. Boris was on a trawl for Hong Kong businessmen
and had a post-box job on the side for the local Soviet residency. Irina ran
courier, boiled down the microdots, and played radio for him on a high-speed
squirt to beat the listeners. That was how it read on paper, see? The two
nightclubs were rendezvous and fallback for his local connect, in that order. But
all Boris really wanted to do was drink and chase the dancing girls and have
depressions. Or else go for five-hour walks because he couldn’t stand being in
the same room with his wife. All Irina did was wait around crying and getting
plastered, and fancy herself sitting alone at Percy’s fireside, telling him all she
knew. I kept her there talking, up on the hill, sitting in the car. I didn’t move
because I didn’t want to break the spell. We watched the dusk fall on the harbour
and the lovely moon come up there, and the peasants slipping by with their long
poles and kerosene lamps. All we needed was Humphrey Bogart in a tuxedo. I
kept my foot on the vodka bottle and let her talk. I didn’t move a muscle. Fact,
Mr. Smiley. Fact,” he declared, with the defence-lessness of a man longing to be
believed, but Smiley’s eyes were closed and he was deaf to all appeal.

“She just completely let go,” Tarr explained, as if it were suddenly an
accident, a thing he had had no part in. “She told me her whole life story, from
birth to Colonel Thomas; that’s me. Mummy, Daddy, early loves, recruitment,
training, her lousy half-marriage, the lot. How her and Boris were teamed at
training and had been together ever since: one of the great unbreakable
relationships. She told me her real name, her work-name, and the cover names
she’d travelled and transmitted by; then she hauled out her handbag and started
showing me her conjuring set: recessed fountain pen, signal plan folded up

inside; concealed camera—the works. 'Wait till Percy sees that/ I tell her—
playing her along, like. It was production-line stuff, mind, nothing coach-built,
but grade-one material all the same. To round it off, she starts barking the dirt
about the Soviet Hong Kong set-up: legmen, safe houses, letter-boxes, the lot. I
was going crazy trying to remember it all.”

“But you did,” said Guillam shortly.

Yes, Tarr agreed; near on, he did. He knew she hadn’t told him the whole
truth, but he knew truth came hard to a girl who’d been a hood since puberty,
and he reckoned that for a beginner she was doing pretty nice.

“I kind of felt for her,” he said with another flash of that false confessiveness.
“I felt we were on the same wave-length, no messing.”

“Quite so,” said Lacon in a rare interjection. He was very pale, but whether
that was anger or the effect of the grey light of early morning creeping through
the shutters, there was no way to tell.

“Now I was in a queer situation. I saw her next day and the day after, and I
reckoned that if she wasn’t already schizoid she was going to be that way damn
soon. One minute talking about Percy giving her a top job in the Circus working
for Colonel Thomas, and arguing the hell with me about whether she should be a
lieutenant or a major. Next minute saying she wouldn’t spy for anybody ever
again and she was going to grow flowers and rut in the hay with Thomas. Then
she had a convent kick: Baptist nuns were going to wash her soul. I nearly died.
Who the hell ever heard of Baptist nuns, I ask her. Never mind, she says.

Baptists are the greatest; her mother was a peasant and knew. That was the
second biggest secret she would ever tell me. 'What’s the biggest, then?’ I ask.
No dice. All she’s saying is, we’re in mortal danger, bigger than I could possibly
know: there’s no hope for either of us unless she has that special chat with
Brother Percy. 'What danger, for Christ’s sake? What do you know that I don’t?’
She was vain as a cat but when I pressed her she clammed up, and I was
frightened to death she’d belt home and sing the lot to Boris. I was running out
of time, too. Then it was Wednesday already and the delegation was due to fly
home to Moscow Friday. Her tradecraft wasn’t all lousy but how could I trust a
nut like her? You know how women are when they fall in love, Mr. Smiley. They
can’t hardly—”

Guillam had already cut him off. “You just keep your head down, right?” he
ordered, and Tarr sulked for a space.

“All I knew was Irina wanted to defect—talk to Percy, as she called it. She
had three days left, and the sooner she jumped the better for everybody. If I
waited much longer, she was going to talk herself out of it. So I took the plunge
and walked in on Thesinger, first thing while he was opening up the shop.”

“Wednesday, the eleventh,” Smiley murmured. “In London the early hours of
the morning.”

“I guess Thesinger thought I was a ghost,” Tarr said. “ 'I’m talking to London,
personal for Head of London Station,’ I said. He argued like hell but he let me do
it. I sat at his desk and coded up the message myself from a one-time pad while
Thesinger watched me like a sick dog. We had to top and tail it like trade code
because Thesinger has export cover. That took me an extra half hour. I was
nervy, I really was. Then I burnt the whole damn pad and typed out the message
on the ticker machine. At that point, there wasn’t a soul on earth but me who
knew what the numbers meant on that sheet of paper—not Thesinger, nobody

but me. I applied for full defector treatment for Irina on emergency procedure. I
held out for all the goodies she’d never even talked about: cash, nationality, a
new identity, no limelight, and a place to live. After all, I was her business
representative in a manner of speaking, wasn’t I, Mr. Smiley?”

Smiley glanced up as if surprised to be addressed. “Yes,” he said quite kindly.
“Yes, I suppose in a manner of speaking that’s what you were.”

“He also had a piece of the action, if I know him,” said Guillam under his
breath.

Catching this or guessing the meaning of it, Tarr was furious.

“That’s a damn lie!” he shouted, colouring deeply. “That’s a—” After glaring
at Guillam a moment longer, he went back to his story.

“I outlined her career to date and her access, including jobs she’d had at
Centre. I asked for inquisitors and an Air Force plane. She thought I was asking
for a personal meeting with Percy Alleline on neutral ground, but I reckoned
we’d cross that bridge when we were past it. I suggested they should send out a
couple of Esterhase’s lamplighters to take charge of her, maybe a tame doctor as
well.”

“Why lamplighters?” Smiley asked sharply. “They’re not allowed to handle
defectors.”

The lamplighters were Toby Esterhase’s pack, based not in Brixton but in
Acton. Their job was to provide the support services for mainline operations:
watching, listening, transport, and safe houses.

“Ah, well, Toby’s come up in the world since your day, Mr. Smiley,” Tarr
explained. “They tell me even his pavement artists ride around in Cadillacs.

Steal the scalp-hunters’ bread out of their mouths, too, if they get the chance—
right, Mr. Guillam?”

“They’ve become the general footpads for Eondon Station,” Guillam said
shortly. “Part of lateralism.”

“I reckoned it would take half a year for the inquisitors to clean her out, and
for some reason she was crazy about Scotland. She had a great wish to spend the
rest of her life there, in fact. With Thomas. Raising our babies in the heather. I
gave it the London Station address group; I graded it flash and by hand of officer
only.”

Guillam put in: “That’s the new formula for maximum limit. It’s supposed to
cut out handling in the coding rooms.”

“But not in London Station?” said Smiley.

“That’s their affair.”

“You heard Bill Haydon got that job, I suppose?” said Lacon, jerking round on
Smiley. “Head of London Station? He’s effectively their chief of operations, just

as Percy used to be when Control was there. They’ve changed all the names,
that’s the thing. You know how your old buddies are about names. You ought to
fill him in, Guillam, bring him up to date.”

“Oh, I think I have the picture, thank you,” Smiley said politely. Of Tarr, with
a deceptive dreaminess, he asked, “She spoke of a great secret, you said?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Did you give any hint of this in your cable to London?”

He had touched something, there was no doubt of it; he had found a spot
where touching hurt, for Tarr winced, and darted a suspicious glance at Lacon,
then at Guillam.

Guessing his meaning, Lacon at once sang out a disclaimer: “Smiley knows
nothing beyond what you have so far told him in this room,” he said. “Correct,
Guillam?” Guillam nodded yes, watching Smiley.

“I told London the same as she’d told me,” Tarr conceded grumpily, like
someone who has been robbed of a good story.

“What form of words, precisely?” Smiley asked. “I wonder whether you
remember that.”

“ 'Claims to have further information crucial to the well-being of the Circus,
but not yet disclosed.’ Near enough, anyhow.”

“Thank you. Thank you very much.”

They waited for Tarr to continue.

“I also requested Head of London Station to inform Mr. Guillam here that I’d
landed on my feet and wasn’t playing hookey for the hell of it.”

“Did that happen?” Smiley asked.

“Nobody said anything to me,” said Guillam dryly.

“I hung around all day for an answer, but by evening it still hadn’t come. Irina
was doing a normal day’s work. I insisted on that, you see. She wanted to stage a
light dose of fever to keep her in bed but I wouldn’t hear of it. The delegation
had factories to visit on Kowloon and I told her to tag along and look intelligent.
I made her swear to keep off the bottle. I didn’t want her involved in amateur
dramatics at the last moment. I wanted it normal right up to when she jumped. I
waited till evening, then cabled a flash follow-up.”

Smiley’s shrouded gaze fixed upon the pale face before him. “You had an
acknowledgement, of course?” he asked.

“ 'We read you.’ That’s all. I sweated out the whole damn night. By dawn I
still didn’t have an answer. I thought. Maybe that R.A.F. plane is already on its
way. London’s playing it long, I thought, tying all the knots before they bring me
in. I mean when you’re that far away from them you have to believe they’re
good. Whatever you think of them, you have to believe that. And I mean now

and then they are—right, Mr. Guillam?”

No one helped him.

“I was worried about Irina, see? I was damn certain that if she had to wait
another day she would crack. Finally the answer did come. It wasn’t an answer
at all. It was a stall: Tell us what sections she worked in, names of former
contacts and acquaintances inside Moscow Centre, name of her present boss,
date of intake into Centre.’ Jesus, I don’t know what else. I drafted a reply fast
because I had a three o’clock date with her down by the church—”

“What church?” Smiley again.

“English Baptist.” To everyone’s astonishment, Tarr was once again blushing.
“She liked to visit there. Not for services, just to sniff around. I hung around the
entrance looking natural but she didn’t show. It was the first time she’d broken a
date. Our fallback was for three hours later on the hilltop, then a one-minute-
fifty descending scale back at the church till we met up. If she was in trouble,
she was going to leave her bathing suit on her window-sill. She was a swimming
nut, swam every day. I shot round to the Alexandra: no bathing suit. I had two
and a half hours to kill. There was nothing I could do any more except wait.”

Smiley said, “What was the priority of London Station’s telegram to you?”

“Immediate.”

“But yours was flash?”

“Both of mine were flash.”

“Was London’s telegram signed?”

Guillam put in: “They’re not any more. Outsiders deal with London Station as
a unit.”

“Was it decypher yourself?”

“No,” said Guillam.

They waited for Tarr to go on.

“I kicked around Thesinger’s office but I wasn’t too popular there; he doesn’t
approve of scalp-hunters and he has a big thing going on the Chinese mainland
that he seemed to think I was going to blow for him. So I sat in a cafe and I had
this idea I just might go down to the airport. It was an idea: like you might say,
“Maybe I’ll go to a movie.” I took the Star Ferry, hired a cab, and told the driver
to go like hell. It got like a panic. I barged the Information queue and asked for
all departures to Russia, or connections in. I nearly went mad going through the
flight lists, yelling at the Chinese clerks, but there wasn’t a plane since yesterday
and none till six tonight. But now I had this hunch. I had to know. What about
charters, what about the unscheduled flights, freight, casual transit? Had nothing,
but really nothing, been routed for Moscow since yesterday morning? Then this
little girl comes through with the answer, one of the Chinese hostesses. She

fancies me, see. She’s doing me a favour. An unscheduled Soviet plane had
taken off two hours ago. Only four passengers boarded. The centre of attraction
was a woman invalid. A lady. In a coma. They had to cart her to the plane on a
stretcher, and her face was wrapped in bandages. Two male nurses went with her
and one doctor—that was the party. I called the Alexandra as a last hope. Neither
Irina nor her so-called husband had checked out of their room, but there was no
reply. The lousy hotel didn’t even know they’d left.”

Perhaps the music had been going on a long time and Smiley only noticed it
now. He heard it in imperfect fragments from different parts of the house: a scale
on a flute, a child’s tune on a recorder, a violin piece more confidently played.
The many Lacon daughters were waking up.

“Perhaps she was ill,” said Smiley stolidly, speaking more to Guillam than
anyone else. “Perhaps she was in a coma. Perhaps they were real nurses who
took her away. By the sound of her, she was a pretty good mess, at best.” He
added, with half a glance at Tarr: “After all, only twenty-four hours had elapsed
between your first telegram and Irina’s departure. You can hardly lay it at
London’s door on that timing.”

“You can just, ” said Guillam, looking at the floor. “It’s extremely fast, but it
does just work, if somebody in London—” They were all waiting. “If somebody
in London had very good footwork. And in Moscow, too, of course.”

“Now, that’s exactly what 1 told myself, sir,” said Tarr proudly, taking up
Smiley’s point and ignoring Guillam’s. “My very words, Mr. Smiley. 'Relax,
Ricki,’ 1 said; 'you’ll be shooting at shadows if you’re not damn careful.’ ”

“Or the Russians tumbled to her,” Smiley said. “The security guards found out
about your affair and removed her. It would be a wonder if they hadn’t found
out, the way you two carried on.”

“Or she told her husband,” Tarr suggested. “1 understand psychology as well
as the next man, sir. 1 know what can happen between a husband and wife when
they have fallen out. She wishes to annoy him. To goad him, to obtain a reaction,
1 thought. 'Want to hear what I’ve been doing while you’ve been out boozing
and cutting the rug?’—like that. Boris peels off and tells the gorillas; they
sandbag her and take her home. 1 went through all those possibilities, Mr.

Smiley, believe me. 1 really worked on them, truth. Same as any man does whose
woman walks out on him.”

“Let’s just have the story, shall we?” Guillam whispered, furious.

Well, now, said Tarr, he would agree that for twenty-four hours he went a bit
berserk: “Now, 1 don’t often get that way—right, Mr. Guillam?”

“Often enough.”

“1 was feeling pretty physical. Frustrated, you could almost say.”

His conviction that a considerable prize had been brutally snatched away from
him drove him to a distracted fury that found expression in a rampage through
old haunts. He went to the Gat’s Gradle, then to Angelika’s, and by dawn he had
taken in half a dozen other places besides, not to mention a few girls along the
way. At some point he crossed town and raised a spot of dust around the
Alexandra. He was hoping to have a couple of words with those security
gorillas. When he sobered down, he got thinking about Irina and their time

together, and he decided before he flew back to London to go round their dead
letter-boxes to check whether by any chance she had written to him before she
left.

Partly it was something to do. “Partly, I guess, I couldn’t bear to think of a
letter of hers kicking around in a hole in a wall while she sweated it out in the
hot seat,” he added, the ever-redeemable boy.

They had two places where they dropped mail for one another. The first was
not far from the hotel on a building site.

“Ever seen that bamboo scaffolding they use? Fantastic. I’ve seen it twenty
storeys high and the coolies swarming over it with slabs of precast concrete.” A
bit of discarded piping, he said, handy at shoulder height. It seemed most likely,
if Irina was in a hurry, that the piping was the letter-box she would use, but when
Tarr went there it was empty. The second was back by the church, “in under
where they stow the pamphlets,” as he put it. “This stand was part of an old
wardrobe, see. If you kneel in the back pew and grope around, there’s a loose
board. Behind the board there’s a recess full of rubbish and rat’s mess. I tell you,
it made a real lovely drop, the best ever.”

There was a short pause, illuminated by the vision of Ricki Tarr and his
Moscow Centre mistress kneeling side by side in the rear pew of a Baptist
church in Hong Kong.

In this dead letter-box, Tarr said, he found not a letter but a whole damn diary.
The writing was fine and done on both sides of the paper, so that quite often the
black ink came through. It was fast urgent writing with no erasures. He knew at a
glance that she had maintained it in her lucid periods.

“This isn’t it, mind. This is only my copy.”

Slipping a long hand inside his shirt, he had drawn out a leather purse attached
to a broad thong of hide. From it he took a grimy wad of paper.

“I guess she dropped the diary just before they hit her,” he said. “Maybe she
was having a last pray at the same time. I made the translation myself.”

“I didn’t know you spoke Russian,” said Smiley—a comment lost to everyone
but Tarr, who at once grinned.

“Ah, now, a man needs a qualification in this profession, Mr. Smiley,” he
explained as he separated the pages. “I may not have been too great at law but a
further language can be decisive. You know what the poets say, I expect?” He
looked up from his labours and his grin widened. “ To possess another language
is to possess another soul.’ A great king wrote that, sir, Charles the Fifth. My
father never forgot a quotation. I’ll say that for him, though the funny thing is he
couldn’t speak a damn thing but English. I’ll read the diary aloud to you, if you
don’t mind.”

“He hasn’t a word of Russian to his name,” said Guillam.

“They spoke English all the time. Irina had done a three-year English course.”

Guillam had chosen the ceiling to look at, Eacon his hands. Only Smiley was
watching Tarr, who was laughing quietly at his own little joke.

“All set?” he enquired. “Right, then. I’ll begin. Thomas, listen, I am talking
to you.’ She called me by my surname,” he explained. “I told her I was Tony, but
it was always Thomas, right? This diary is my gift for you in case they take me
away before I speak to Alleline. I would prefer to give you my life, Thomas, and
naturally my body, but I think it more likely that this wretched secret will be all I
have to make you happy. Use it well!’ ” Tarr glanced up. “It’s marked Monday.
She wrote the diary over the four days.” His voice had become flat, almost
bored. “ Tn Moscow Gentre there is more gossip than our superiors would wish.
Especially the little fellows like to make themselves grand by appearing to be in
the know. For two years before I was attached to the Trade Ministry, I worked as
a supervisor in the filing department of our headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square.
The work was so dull, Thomas, the atmosphere was not happy, and I was
unmarried. We were encouraged to be suspicious of one another; it is such a
strain never to give your heart, not once. Under me was a clerk named Ivlov.
Though Ivlov was not socially or in rank my equal, the oppressive atmosphere
brought out a mutuality in our temperaments. Forgive me, sometimes only the
body can speak for us—you should have appeared earlier, Thomas! Several
times Ivlov and I worked night shifts together, and eventually we agreed to defy
regulations and meet outside the building. He was blond, Thomas, like you, and
I wanted him. We met in a cafe in a poor district of Moscow. In Russia we are
taught that Moscow has no poor districts, but this is a lie. Ivlov told me that his
real name was Brod but he was not a Jew. He brought me some coffee sent to
him illicitly by a comrade in Teheran—he was very sweet—also some stockings.
Ivlov told me that he admired me greatly and that he had once worked in a
section responsible for recording the particulars of all the foreign agents
employed by Gentre. I laughed and told him that no such record existed; it was
an idea of dreamers to suppose so many secrets would be in one place. Well, we
were both dreamers I suppose.’ ”

Again Tarr broke off. “We get a new day,” he announced. “She kicks off with
a lot of 'good morning Thomas’s,’ prayers, and a bit of love-talk. A woman can’t
write to the air, she says, so she’s writing to Thomas. Her old man’s gone out
early; she’s got an hour to herself. Okay?”

Smiley grunted.

“ 'On the second occasion with Ivlov, I met him in the room of a cousin of
Ivlov’s wife, a teacher at Moscow State University. No one else was present. The

meeting, which was extremely secret, involved what in a report we would call an
incriminating act. 1 think, Thomas, you yourself once or twice committed such
an act! Also at this meeting Ivlov told me the following story to bind us in even
closer friendship. Thomas, you must take care. Have you heard of Karla? He is
an old fox, the most cunning in the Centre, the most secret; even his name is not
a name that Russians understand. Ivlov was extremely frightened to tell me this
story, which according to Ivlov concerned a great conspiracy, perhaps the
greatest we have. The story of Ivlov is as follows. You should tell it only to most
trustworthy people, Thomas, because of its extremely conspiratorial nature. You
must tell no one in the Circus, for no one can be trusted until the riddle is solved.
Ivlov said it was not true that he once worked on agent records. He had invented
this story only to show me the great depth of his knowledge concerning the
Centre’s affairs and to assure me that 1 was not in love with a nobody. The truth
was he had worked for Karla as a helper in one of Karla’s great conspiracies and
he had actually been stationed in England in a conspiratorial capacity, under the
cover of being a driver and assistant coding clerk at the Embassy. For this task
he was provided with the workname Lapin. Thus Brod became Ivlov and Ivlov
became Lapin: of this poor Ivlov was extremely proud. (1 did not tell him what
Lapin means in French.) That a man’s wealth should be counted by the number
of his names! Ivlov’s task was to service a mole. A mole is a deep-penetration
agent so called because he burrows deep into the fabric of Western imperialism,
in this case an Englishman. Moles are very precious to the Centre because of the
many years it takes to place them, often fifteen or twenty. Most of the English
moles were recruited by Karla before the war and came from the higher
bourgeoisie, even aristocrats and nobles who were disgusted with their origins,
and became secretly fanatic, much more fanatic than their working-class English
comrades, who are slothful. Several were applying to join the Party when Karla
stopped them in time and directed them to special work. Some fought in Spain
against Franco Fascism, and Karla’s talent-spotters found them there and turned
them over to Karla for recruitment. Others were recruited in the war during the
alliance of expediency between Soviet Russia and Britain. Others afterwards,
disappointed that the war did not bring Socialism to the West...’ It kind of dries
up here,” Tarr announced without looking anywhere but at his own manuscript.

“1 wrote down, 'dries up.’ 1 guess her old man came back earlier than she
expected. The ink’s all blotted. God knows where she stowed the damn thing.
Under the mattress maybe.”

If this was meant as a joke, it failed.

“The mole whom Lapin serviced in London was known by the code name
Gerald. He had been recruited by Karla and was the object of extreme

conspiracy. The servicing of moles is performed only by comrades with a very
high standard of ability, said Ivlov. Thus while in appearance Ivlov-Lapin was at
the Embassy a mere nobody, subjected to many humiliations on account of his
apparent insignificance, such as standing with women behind the bar at
functions, by right he was a great man, the secret assistant to Colonel Gregor
Viktorov, whose workname at the Embassy is Polyakov.’ ”

Here Smiley made his one interjection, asking for the spelling. Like an actor
disturbed in midflow, Tarr answered rudely, “P-o-l-y-a-k-o-v, got it?”

“Thank you,” said Smiley with unshakeable courtesy, in a manner which
conveyed conclusively that the name had no significance for him whatever. Tarr
resumed.

“ ' Viktorov is himself an old professional of great cunning, said Ivlov. His
cover job is cultural attache and that is how he speaks to Karla. As Cultural
Attache Polyakov, he organises lectures to British universities and societies
concerning cultural matters in the Soviet Union, but his nightwork as Colonel
Gregor Viktorov is briefing and debriefing the mole Gerald on instruction from
Karla at Centre. For this purpose. Colonel Viktorov-Polyakov uses legmen and
poor Ivlov was for a while one. Nevertheless it is Karla in Moscow who is the
real controller of the mole Gerald.’ ”

“Now it really changes,” said Tarr. “She’s writing at night and she’s either
plastered or scared out of her pants, because she’s going all over the damn page.
There’s talk about footsteps in the corridor and the dirty looks she’s getting from
the gorillas. Not transcribed—right, Mr. Smiley?” And, receiving a small nod, he
went on: “ The measures for the mole’s security were remarkable. Written
reports from London to Karla at Moscow Centre even after coding were cut in
two and sent by separate couriers, others in secret inks underneath orthodox
Embassy correspondence. Ivlov told me that the mole Gerald produced at times
more conspiratorial material than Viktorov-Polyakov could conveniently handle.
Much was on undeveloped film, often thirty reels in a week. Anyone opening the
container in the wrong fashion at once exposed the film. Other material was
given by the mole in speeches, at extremely conspiratorial meetings, and
recorded on special tape that could only be played through complicated
machines. This tape was also wiped clean by exposure to light or to the wrong
machine. The meetings were of the crash type, always different, always sudden,
that is all I know except that it was the time when the Fascist aggression in
Vietnam was at its worst; in England the extreme reactionaries had again taken
the power. Also that according to Ivlov-Lapin, the mole Gerald was a high
functionary in the Circus. Thomas, I tell you this because, since I love you, I
have decided to admire all English, you most of all. I do not wish to think of an

English gentleman behaving as a traitor, though naturally I believe he was right
to join the workers’ cause. Also I fear for the safety of anyone employed by the
Circus in a conspiracy. Thomas, I love you; take care with this knowledge—it
could hurt you also. Ivlov was a man like you, even if they called him Lapin ...’
” Tarr paused diffidently. “There’s a bit at the end which ...”

“Read it,” Guiham murmured.

Lifting the wad of paper slightly sideways, Tarr read in the same flat drawl: “
Thomas, I am telling you this also because I am afraid. This morning when I
woke, he was sitting on the bed, staring at me like a madman. When I went
downstairs for coffee, the guards Trepov and Novikov watched me like animals,
eating very carelessly. I am sure they had been there hours; also from the
Residency, Avilov sat with them, a boy. Have you been indiscreet, Thomas? Did
you tell more than you let me think? Now you see why only Aheline would do.
You need not blame yourself; I can guess what you have told them. In my heart I
am free. You have seen only the bad things in me—the drink, the fear, the lies
we live. But deep inside me burns a new and blessed light. I used to think that
the secret world was a separate place and that I was banished for ever to an
island of half-people. But, Thomas, it is not separate. God has shown me that it
is here, right in the middle of the real world, ah round us, and we have only to
open the door and step outside to be free. Thomas, you must always long for the
light which I have found. It is called love. Now I shall take this to our secret
place and leave it there while there is still time.

Dear God, I hope there is. God give me sanctuary in His Church. Remember
it: I loved you there also.’ ” Tarr was extremely pale, and his hands, as he pulled
open his shirt to return the diary to its purse, were trembling and moist. “There’s
a last bit,” he said. “It goes: Thomas, why could you remember so few prayers
from your boyhood? Your father was a great and good man.’ Like I told you,” he
explained, “she was crazy.”

Lacon had opened the blinds and now the full white light of day was pouring
into the room. The windows looked onto a small paddock where Jackie Lacon, a
fat little girl in plaits and a riding hat, was cautiously cantering her pony.

9

Before Tarr left, Smiley asked a number of questions of him. He was gazing not
at Tarr but myopically into the middle distance, his pouchy face despondent from
the tragedy.

“Where is the original of that diary?”

“I put it straight back in the dead letter-box. Figure it this way, Mr. Smiley: by
the time I found the diary, Irina had been in Moscow twenty-four hours. I
guessed she wouldn’t have a lot of breath when it came to the interrogation.

Most likely they’d sweated her on the plane, then a second going over when she
touched down, then question one as soon as the big boys had finished their
breakfast. That’s the way they do it to the timid ones: the arm first and the
questions after, right? So it might be only a matter of a day or two before Centre
sent along a footpad to take a peek round the back of the church, okay?” Primly
again: “Also I had my own welfare to consider.”

“He means that Moscow Centre would be less interested in cutting his throat
if they thought he hadn’t read the diary,” said Guillam.

“Did you photograph it?”

“I don’t carry a camera. I bought a dollar notebook. I copied the diary into the
notebook. The original I put back. The whole job took me four hours flat.” He
glanced at Guillam, then away from him. In the fresh daylight, a deep inner fear
was suddenly apparent in Tarr’s face. “When I got back to the hotel, my room
was a wreck; they’d even stripped the paper off the walls. The manager told me,
'Get the hell out.’ He didn’t want to know.”

“He’s carrying a gun,” said Guillam. “He won’t part with it.”

“You’re damn right I won’t.”

Smiley offered a dyspeptic grunt of sympathy. “These meetings you had with
Irina: the dead letter-boxes, the safety signals, and fallbacks. Who proposed the
tradecraft, you or she?”

“She did.”

“What were the safety signals?”

“Body-talk. If I wore my collar open, she knew I’d had a look around and I
reckoned the coast was clear. If I wore it closed, scrub the meeting till the
fallback.”

“And Irina?”

“Handbag. Left hand, right hand. I got there first and waited up somewhere
she could see me. That gave her the choice: whether to go ahead or split.”

“All this happened more than six months ago. What have you been doing
since?”

“Resting,” said Tarr rudely.

Guillam said, “He panicked and went native. He bolted to Kuala Lumpur, then
lay up in one of the hill villages. That’s his stoiy. He has a daughter called
Danny.”

“Danny’s my little kid.”

“He shacked up with Danny and her mother,” said Guillam, talking, as was his
habit, clean across anything Tarr said. “He’s got wives scattered across the globe,
but she seems to lead the pack just now.”

“Why did you choose this particular moment to come to us?”

Tarr said nothing.

“Don’t you want to spend Ghristmas with Danny?”

“Sure.”

“So what happened? Did something scare you?”

“There was rumours,” said Tarr sullenly.

“What sort of rumours?”

“Some Frenchman turned up in K.L. telling them all I owed him money.
Wanted to get some lawyer hounding me. I don’t owe anybody money.”

Smiley returned to Guillam. “At the Gircus he’s still posted as a defector?”

“Presumed.”

“What have they done about it so far?”

“It’s out of my hands. I heard on the grapevine that London Station held a
couple of war parties over him a while back, but they didn’t invite me and I
don’t know what came of them. Nothing, I should think, as usual.”

“What passport’s he been using?”

Tarr had his answer ready: “I threw away Thomas the day I hit Malaya. I
reckoned Thomas wasn’t exactly the flavour of the month in Moscow and I’d do
better to kill him off right there. In K.L. I had them run me up a British.” He
handed it to Smiley. “Name of Poole. It’s not bad for the money.”

“Why didn’t you use one of your Swiss escapes?”

Another wary pause.

“Or did you lose them when your hotel room was searched?”

Guillam said, “He cached them as soon as he arrived in Hong Kong. Standard
practice.”

“So why didn’t you use them?”

“They were numbered, Mr. Smiley. They may have been blank but they were
numbered. I was feeling a mite windy, frankly. If London had the numbers,
maybe Moscow did, too, if you take my meaning.”

“So what did you do with your Swiss escapes?” Smiley repeated pleasantly.

“He says he threw them away,” said Guillam. “He sold them, more likely. Or
swapped them for that one.”

“How? Threw them away how? Did you burn them?”

“That’s right, I burned them,” said Tarr with a nervy ring to his voice, half a
threat, half fear.

“So when you say this Frenchman was enquiring for you—”

“He was looking for Poole.”

“But who else ever heard of Poole, except the man who faked this passport?”
Smiley asked, turning the pages. Tarr said nothing. “Tell me how you travelled
to England,” Smiley suggested.

“Soft route from Dublin. No problem.” Tarr lied badly under pressure.

Perhaps his parents were to blame. He was too fast when he had no answer
ready, too aggressive when he had one up his sleeve.

“How did you get to Dublin?” Smiley asked, checking the border stamps on
the middle page.

“Roses.” He had recovered his confidence. “Roses all the way. I’ve got a girl
who’s an air hostess with South African. A pal of mine flew me cargo to the
Cape; at the Cape my girl took care of me, then hitched me a free ride to Dublin
with one of the pilots. As far as anyone back East knows, I never left the
peninsula.”

“I’m doing what I can to check,” said Guillam to the ceiling.

“Well, you be damn careful, baby,” Tarr snapped down the line to Guillam.
“Because I don’t want the wrong people on my back.”

“Why did you come to Mr. Guillam?” Smiley enquired, still deep in Poole’s
passport. It had a used, well-thumbed look, neither too full nor too empty. “Apart
from the fact that you were frightened, of course.”

“Mr. Guillam’s my boss,” said Tarr virtuously.

“Did it cross your mind he might just turn you straight over to Alleline? After
all, you’re something of a wanted man as far as the Circus top brass is
concerned, aren’t you?”

“Sure. But I don’t figure Mr. Guillam’s any fonder of the new arrangement
than you are, Mr. Smiley.”

“He also loves England,” Guillam explained with mordant sarcasm.

“Sure. I got homesick.”

“Did you ever consider going to anyone else but Mr. Guillam? Why not one of
the overseas residencies, for instance, where you were in less danger? Is
Mackelvore still headman in Paris?” Guillam nodded. “There you are, then: you
could have gone to Mr. Mackelvore. He recruited you, you can trust him: he’s

old Circus. You could have sat safely in Paris instead of risking your neck over
here. Oh, dear God. Lacon, quick!”

Smiley had risen to his feet, the back of one hand pressed to his mouth as he
stared out the window. In the paddock Jackie Lacon was lying on her stomach
screaming while a riderless pony careered between the trees. They were still
watching as Lacon’s wife, a pretty woman with long hair and thick winter
stockings, bounded over the fence and gathered the child up.

“They’re often taking tumbles,” Lacon remarked, quite cross. “They don’t
hurt themselves at that age.” And scarcely more graciously: “You’re not
responsible for everyone, you know, George.”

Slowly they settled again.

“And if you had been making for Paris,” Smiley resumed, “which route would
you have taken?”

“The same till Ireland, then Dublin-Orly, I guess. What do you expect me to
do—walk on the damn water?”

At this Lacon coloured and Guillam with an angry exclamation rose to his
feet. But Smiley seemed quite unbothered. Taking up the passport again, he
turned slowly back to the beginning.

“And how did you get in touch with Mr. Guillam?”

Guillam answered for him, speaking fast: “He knew where I garage my car.

He left a note on it saying he wanted to buy it and signed it with his workname
Trench. He suggested a place to meet and put in a veiled plea for privacy before
I took my trade elsewhere. I brought Fawn along to baby-sit—”

Smiley interrupted: “That was Fawn at the door just now?”

“He watched my back while we talked,” Guillam said. “I’ve kept him with us
ever since. As soon as I’d heard Tarr’s story, I rang Lacon from a call-box and
asked for an interview ... George, why don’t we talk this over among
ourselves?”

“Rang Lacon down here or in London?”

“Down here,” said Lacon.

There was a pause till Guillam explained. “I happened to remember the name
of a girl in Lacon’s office. I mentioned her name and said she had asked me to
speak to him urgently on an intimate matter. It wasn’t perfect but it was the best I
could think of on the spur of the moment.” He added, filling the silence, “Well,
damn it, there was no reason to suppose the phone was tapped.”

“There was every reason.”

Smiley had closed the passport and was examining the binding by the light of
a tattered reading lamp at his side. “This is rather good, isn’t it?” he remarked
lightly. “Really very good indeed. I’d say that was a professional product. I can’t

find a blemish.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Smiley,” Tarr retorted, taking it back; “it’s not made in
Russia.” By the time he reached the door, his smile had returned. “You know
something?” he said, addressing all three of them down the aisle of the long
room. “If Irina is right, you boys are going to need a whole new Circus. So if we
all stick together I guess we could be in on the ground floor.” He gave the door a
playful tap. “Come on, darling, it’s me. Ricki.”

“Thank you! It’s all right now! Open up, please,” Lacon shouted, and a
moment later the key was turned, the dark figure of Fawn the baby-sitter flitted
into view, and then the footsteps faded into the big hollows of the house, to the
distant accompaniment of Jackie Lacon’s crying.

10

On another side of the house, away from the pony paddock, a grass tennis court
was hidden among the trees. It was not a good tennis court; it was mown seldom.
In spring the grass was sodden from the winter and no sun got in to dry it, in
summer the balls disappeared into the foliage, and this morning it was ankle
deep in frosted leaves that had collected from all over the garden. But round the
outside, roughly following the wire rectangle, a footpath wandered between
some beech trees and here Smiley and Lacon wandered also. Smiley had fetched
his travelling coat but Lacon wore only his threadbare suit. For this reason,
perhaps, he chose a brisk, if unco-ordinated, pace which with each stride took
him well ahead of Smiley, so that he had constantly to hover, shoulders and
elbows lifted, waiting till the shorter man caught up. Then he promptly bounded
off again, gaining ground. They completed two laps in this way before Lacon
broke the silence.

“When you came to me a year ago with a similar suggestion, Tm afraid I
threw you out. I suppose I should apologise. I was remiss.” There was a suitable
silence while he pondered his dereliction. “I instructed you to abandon your
enquiries.”

“You told me they were unconstitutional,” Smiley said mournfully, as if he
were recalling the same sad error.

“Was that the word I used? Good Lord, how very pompous of me!”

From the direction of the house came the sound of Jackie’s continued crying.

“You never had any, did you?” Lacon piped at once, his head lifted to the
sound.

“I’m sorry?”

“Children. You and Ann.”

“ No.”

“Nephews, nieces?”

“One nephew.”

“On your side?”

“Hers.”

Perhaps I never left the place, Smiley thought, peering around him at the
tangled roses, the broken swings and sodden sandpits, the raw red house so shrill
in the morning light. Perhaps we’re still here from last time.

Lacon was apologising again: “Dare I say I didn’t absolutely trust your
motives? It rather crossed my mind that Control had put you up to it, you see. As

a way of hanging on to power and keeping Alleline out”—swirling away again,
long strides, wrists outward.

“Oh, no, I assure you Control knew nothing about it at all.”

“I realise that now. I didn’t at the time. It’s a little difficult to know when to
trust you people and when not. You do live by rather different standards, don’t
you? I mean you have to. I accept that. I’m not being judgemental. Our aims are
the same, after all, even if our methods are different”—bounding over a cattle
ditch. “I once heard someone say morality was method. Do you hold with that? I
suppose you wouldn’t. You would say that morality was vested in the aim, I
expect. Difficult to know what one’s aims are, that’s the trouble, specially if
you’re British. We can’t expect you people to determine our policy for us, can
we? We can only ask you to further it. Correct? Tricky one, that.”

Rather than chase after him, Smiley sat on a rusted swing seat and huddled
himself more tightly in his coat, till finally Lacon stalked back and perched
beside him. For a while they rocked together to the rhythm of the groaning
springs.

“Why the devil did she choose Tarr?” Lacon muttered at last, fiddling his long
fingers. “Of all the people in the world to choose for a confessor, I can imagine
none more miserably unsuitable.”

“I’m afraid you’ll have to ask a woman that question, not us,” said Smiley,
wondering again where Immingham was.

“Oh, indeed,” Lacon agreed lavishly. “All that’s a complete mystery. I’m
seeing the Minister at eleven,” he confided, in a lower tone. “I have to put him in
the picture. Your parliamentary cousin,” he added, forcing an intimate joke.

“Ann’s cousin, actually,” Smiley corrected him, in the same absent tone. “Far
removed I may add, but cousin for all that.”

“And Bill Haydon is also Ann’s cousin? Our distinguished Head of London
Station.” They had played this game before as well.

“By a different route, yes. Bill is also her cousin.” He added quite uselessly:
“She comes from an old family with a strong political tradition. With time it’s
rather spread.”

“The tradition?”—Lacon loved to nail an ambiguity.

“The family.”

Beyond the trees, Smiley thought, cars are passing. Beyond the trees lies a
whole world, but Lacon has this red castle and a sense of Christian ethic that
promises him no reward except a knighthood, the respect of his peers, a fat
pension, and a couple of charitable directorships in the City.

“Anyway I’m seeing him at eleven.” Lacon had jerked to his feet and they
were walking again. Smiley caught the name “Ellis” floating backward to him

on the leafy morning air. For a moment, as in the car with Guillam, an odd
nervousness overcame him.

“After all,” Lacon was saying, “we both held perfectly honourable positions.
You felt that Ellis had been betrayed and you wanted a witch-hunt. My Minister
and I felt there had been gross incompetence on the part of Control—a view
which to put it mildly the Foreign Office shared—and we wanted a new broom.”

“Oh, I quite understood your dilemma,” said Smiley, more to himself than to
Lacon.

“Fm glad. And don’t forget, George: you were Control’s man. Control
preferred you to Haydon, and when he lost his grip towards the end—and
launched that whole extraordinary adventure—it was you who fronted for him.
No one but you, George. It’s not every day that the head of one’s secret service
embarks on a private war against the Czechs.” It was clear that the memory still
smarted. “In other circumstances, I suppose, Haydon might have gone to the
wall, but you were in the hot seat and—”

“And Percy Alleline was the Minister’s man,” said Smiley, mildly enough for
Lacon to slow himself and listen.

“It wasn’t as if you had a suspect, you know! You didn’t point the finger at
anyone! A directionless enquiry can be extraordinarily destructive!”

“Whereas a new broom sweeps cleaner.”

“Percy Alleline has produced intelligence instead of scandals, he has stuck to
the letter of his charter and won the trust of the customers. And he has not, to my
knowledge, invaded Czechoslovak territory. All in all he has done extremely
well.”

“With Bill Haydon to field for him, who wouldn’t?”

“Control, for one,” said Lacon, with punch.

They had drawn up at an empty swimming pool and now stood staring into the
deep end. From its grimy depths Smiley fancied he heard again the insinuating
tones of Roddy Martindale: “Little reading rooms at the Admiralty, little
committees popping up with funny names ...”

“Is that special source of Percy’s still running?” Smiley enquired. “The
Witchcraft material, or whatever it’s called these days?”

“I didn’t know you were on the list,” Lacon said, not at all pleased. “Since you
ask, yes. Source Merlin’s our mainstay and Witchcraft is still the name of his
product. The Circus hasn’t turned in such good material for years. Since I can
remember, in fact.”

“And still subject to all that special handling?”

“Certainly, and now that this has happened I’ve no doubt that we shall take
even more rigorous precautions.”

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Gerald might smell a rat.”

“That’s the point, isn’t it?” Lacon observed quickly. His strength was
improbable, Smiley reflected. One minute he was like a thin, drooping boxer
whose gloves were too big for his wrists; the next he had reached out and rocked
you against the ropes, and was surveying you with Christian compassion. “We
can’t move. We can’t investigate because all the instruments of enquiry are in the
Circus’s hands, perhaps in the mole Gerald’s. We can’t watch, or listen, or open
mail. To do any one of those things would require the resources of Esterhase’s
lamplighters, and Esterhase like anyone else must be suspect. We can’t
interrogate; we can’t take steps to limit a particular person’s access to delicate
secrets. To do any of these things would be to run the risk of alarming the mole.
It’s the oldest question of all, George. Who can spy on the spies? Who can smell
out the fox without running with him?” He made an awful stab at humour:

“Mole, rather,” he said, in a confiding aside.

In a fit of energy Smiley had broken away and was pounding ahead of Lacon
down the path that led towards the paddock.

“Then go to the competition,” he called. “Go to the security people. They’re
the experts; they’ll do you a job.”

“The Minister won’t have that. You know perfectly well how he and Alleline
feel about the competition. Rightly, too, if I may say so. A lot of ex-colonial
administrators ploughing through Circus papers: you might as well bring in the
army to investigate the navy!”

“That’s no comparison at all,” Smiley objected.

But Lacon as a good civil servant had his second metaphor ready: “Very well,
the Minister would rather live with a damp roof than see his castle pulled down
by outsiders. Does that satisfy you? He has a perfectly good point, George. We
do have agents in the field, and I wouldn’t give much for their chances once the
security gentlemen barge in.”

Now it was Smiley’s turn to slow down. “How many?”

“Six hundred, give or take a few.”

“And behind the Curtain?”

“We budget for a hundred and twenty.” With numbers, with facts of all sorts,
Lacon never faltered. They were the gold he worked with, wrested from the grey
bureaucratic earth. “So far as I can make out from the financial returns, almost
all of them are presently active.” He took a long bound. “So I can tell him you’ll
do it, can I?” he sang quite casually, as if the question were mere formality,
check the appropriate box. “You’ll take the job, clean the stables? Go backwards,
go forwards, do whatever is necessary? It’s your generation, after all. Your
legacy.”

Smiley had pushed open the paddock gate and slammed it behind him. They
were facing each other over its rickety frame. Lacon, slightly pink, wore a
dependent smile.

“Why do I say Ellis?” he asked conversationally. “Why do I talk about the
Ellis affair when the poor man’s name was Prideaux?”

“Ellis was his workname.”

“Of course. So many scandals in those days, one forgets the details.” Hiatus.
Swinging of the right forearm. Lunge. “And he was Haydon’s friend, not
yours?” Lacon enquired.

“They were at Oxford together before the war.”

“And stablemates in the Circus during and after. The famous Haydon-
Prideaux partnership. My predecessor spoke of it interminably.” He repeated,
“But you were never close to him?”

“To Prideaux? No.”

“Not a cousin, I mean?”

“For heaven’s sake,” Smiley breathed.

Lacon grew suddenly awkward again, but a dogged purpose kept his gaze on
Smiley. “And there’s no emotional or other reason which you feel might debar
you from the assignment? You must speak up, George,” he insisted anxiously, as
if speaking up were the last thing he wanted. He waited a fraction, then threw it
all away: “Though I see no real case. There’s always a part of us that belongs to
the public domain, isn’t there? The social contract cuts both ways; you always
knew that. I’m sure. So did Prideaux.”

“What does that mean?”

“Well, good Lord, he was shot, George. A bullet in the back is held to be quite
a sacrifice, isn’t it, even in your world?”

Alone, Smiley stood at the further end of the paddock, under the dripping
trees, trying to make sense of his emotions while he reached for breath. Like an
old illness, his anger had taken him by surprise. Ever since his retirement, he had
been denying its existence, steering clear of anything that could touch it off:
newspapers, former colleagues, gossip of the Martindale sort. After a lifetime of
living by his wits and his considerable memory, he had given himself full time to
the profession of forgetting. He had forced himself to pursue scholarly interests
which had served him well enough as a distraction while he was at the Gircus,
but which now that he was unemployed were nothing, absolutely nothing. He
could have shouted: Nothing!

“Burn the lot,” Ann had suggested helpfully, referring to his books. “Set fire
to the house. But don’t rot.”

If by rot, she meant conform, she was right to read that as his aim. He had
tried, really tried, as he approached what the insurance advertisements were
pleased to call the evening of his life, to be all that a model rentier should be;
though no one, least of all Ann, thanked him for the effort. Each morning as he
got out of bed, each evening as he went back to it, usually alone, he had
reminded himself that he never was and never had been indispensable. He had
schooled himself to admit that in those last wretched months of Control’s career,
when disasters followed one another with heady speed, he had been guilty of
seeing things out of proportion. And if the old professional Adam rebelled in
him now and then and said: You know the place went bad, you know Jim
Prideaux was betrayed—and what more eloquent testimony is there than a bullet,
two bullets, in the back? Well, he had replied, suppose he did? And suppose he
was right? “It is sheer vanity to believe that one fat middle-aged spy is the only
person capable of holding the world together,” he would tell himself. And other
times: “I never heard of anyone yet who left the Circus without some unfinished
business.”

Only Ann, though she could not read his workings, refused to accept his
findings. She was quite passionate, in fact, as only women can be on matters of
business, really driving him to go back, take up where he had left off, never to
veer aside in favour of the easy arguments. Not of course that she knew
anything, but what woman was ever stopped by a want of information? She felt.
And despised him for not acting in accordance with her feelings.

And now, at the very moment when he was near enough beginning to believe
his own dogma, a feat made no easier by Ann’s infatuation for an out-of-work
actor, what happens but that the assembled ghosts of his past—Lacon, Control,
Karla, Alleline, Esterhase, Bland, and finally Bill Haydon himself—barge into
his cell and cheerfully inform him, as they drag him back to this same garden,
that everything he had been calling vanity is truth?

“Haydon,” he repeated to himself, no longer able to stem the tides of memory.
Even the name was like a jolt. “I’m told that you and Bill shared everything once
upon a time,” said Martindale. He stared at his chubby hands, watching them
shake. Too old? Impotent? Afraid of the chase? Or afraid of what he might
unearth at the end of it? “There are always a dozen reasons for doing nothing,”
Ann liked to say—it was a favourite apologia, indeed, for many of her
misdemeanours—“There is only one reason for doing something. And that’s
because you want to.” Or have to? Ann would furiously deny it: coercion, she
would say, is just another word for doing what you want; or for not doing what
you are afraid of.

Middle children weep longer than their brothers and sisters. Over her mother’s
shoulder, stilling her pains and her injured pride, Jackie Lacon watched the party
leave. First, two men she had not seen before: one tall, one short and dark. They
drove off in a small green van. No one waved to them, she noticed, or even said
goodbye. Next, her father left in his own car; lastly a blond, good-looking man
and a short fat one in an enormous overcoat like a pony blanket made their way
to a sports car parked under the beech trees. For a moment she really thought
there must be something wrong with the fat one, he followed so slowly and so
painfully. Then, seeing the handsome man hold the car door for him, he seemed
to wake, and hurried forward with a lumpy skip. Unaccountably, this gesture
upset her afresh. A storm of sorrow seized her and her mother could not console
her.

11

Peter Guillam was a chivalrous fellow whose conscious loyalties were
determined by his affections. The others had been made over long ago to the
Circus. His father, a French businessman, had spied for a Circus reseau in the
war while his mother, an Englishwoman, did mysterious things with codes. Until
eight years ago, under the cover of a shipping clerk, Guillam himself had run his
own agents in French North Africa, which was considered a murderous
assignment. He was blown, his agents were hanged, and he entered the long
middle age of the grounded pro. He did hackwork in London, sometimes for
Smiley, ran a few home-based operations, including a network of girlfriends who
were not, as the jargon has it, inter-conscious, and when Alleline’s crowd took
over he was shoved out to grass in Brixton—he supposed because he had the
wrong connections, among them Smiley. That, resolutely, was how until last
Friday he would have told the story of his life. Of his relationship with Smiley
he would have dwelt principally upon the end.

Guillam was living mainly in London docks in those days, where he was
putting together low-grade Marine networks from whatever odd Polish, Russian,
and Chinese seamen he and a bunch of talent-spotters occasionally managed to
get their hands on. Betweenwhiles he sat in a small room on the first floor of the
Circus and consoled a pretty secretary called Mary, and he was quite happy
except that no one in authority would answer his minutes. When he used the
phone, he got “engaged” or no answer. He had heard vaguely there was trouble,
but there was always trouble. It was common knowledge, for instance, that
Alleline and Control had locked horns, but they had been doing little else for
years. He also knew, like everyone else, that a big operation had aborted in
Czechoslovakia, that the Foreign Office and the Defence Ministry had jointly
blown a gasket, and that Jim Prideaux—head of scalp-hunters, the oldest Czecho
hand, and Bill Haydon’s lifelong stringer—had been shot up and put in the bag.
Hence, he assumed, the loud silence and the glum faces. Hence also Bill
Haydon’s manic anger, of which the news spread like a nervous thrill through all
the building: like God’s wrath, said Mary, who loved a full-scale passion. Later
he heard the catastrophe called Testify. Testify, Haydon told him much later, was
the most incompetent bloody operation ever launched by an old man for his
dying glory, and Jim Prideaux was the price of it. Bits made the newspapers,
there were parliamentary questions, and even rumours, never officially
confirmed, that British troops in Germany had been put on full alert.

Eventually, by sauntering in and out of other people’s offices, he began to
realise what everyone else had realised some weeks before. The Circus wasn’t
just silent, it was frozen. Nothing was coming in, nothing was going out; not at
the level on which Guillam moved, anyhow. Inside the building, people in
authority had gone to earth, and when pay day came round there were no buff
envelopes in the pigeon-holes because, according to Mary, the housekeepers had
not received the usual monthly authority to issue them. Now and then somebody
would say they had seen Alleline leaving his club and he looked furious. Or
Control getting into his car and he looked sunny. Or that Bill Haydon had
resigned, on the grounds that he had been overruled or undercut, but Bill was
always resigning. This time, said the rumour, the grounds were somewhat
different, however: Haydon was furious that the Circus would not pay the Czech
price for Jim Prideaux’s repatriation; it was said to be too high in agents, or
prestige. And that Bill had broken out in one of his fits of chauvinism and
declared that any price was fair to get one loyal Englishman home: give them
everything, only get Jim back.

Then, one evening, Smiley peered round Guillam’s door and suggested a
drink. Mary didn’t realise who he was and just said “Hullo” in her stylish
classless drawl. As they walked out of the Circus side by side, Smiley wished the
janitors good night with unusual terseness, and in the pub in Wardour Street he
said, “I’ve been sacked,” and that was all.

From the pub they went to a wine bar off Charing Cross, a cellar with music
playing and no one there. “Did they give any reason?” Guillam enquired. “Or is
it just because you’ve lost your figure?”

It was the word “reason” that Smiley fixed on. He was by then politely but
thoroughly drunk, but reason, as they walked unsteadily along the Thames
embankment, reason got through to him.

“Reason as logic, or reason as motive?” he demanded, sounding less like
himself than Bill Haydon, whose pre-war, Oxford Union style of polemic
seemed in those days to be in everybody’s ears. “Or reason as a way of life?”
They sat on a bench. “They don’t have to give me reasons. I can write my own
damn reasons. And that is not the same,” he insisted as Guillam guided him
carefully into a cab, gave the driver the money and the address, “that is not the
same as the half-baked tolerance that comes from no longer caring.”

“Amen,” said Guillam, fully realising as he watched the cab pull into the
distance that by the rules of the Circus their friendship, such as it was, had that
minute ended. Next day Guillam learned that more heads had rolled and that
Percy Alleline was to stand in as night watchman with the title of acting chief,
and that Bill Haydon, to everyone’s astonishment, but most likely out of

persisting anger with Control, would serve under him; or, as the wise ones said,
over him.

By Christmas, Control was dead. “They’ll get you next,” said Mary, who saw
these events as a second storming of the Winter Palace, and she wept when
Guillam departed for the siberias of Brixton, ironically to fill Jim Prideaux’s slot.

Climbing the four steps to the Circus that wet Monday afternoon, his mind
bright with the prospect of felony, Guillam passed these events in review and
decided that today was the beginning of the road back.

He had spent the previous night at his spacious flat in Eaton Place in the
company of Camilla, a music student with a long body and a sad, beautiful face.
Though she was not more than twenty, her black hair was streaked with grey, as
if from a shock she never talked about. As another effect, perhaps, of the same
undescribed trauma, she ate no meat, wore no leather, and drank nothing
alcoholic; only in love, it seemed to Guillam, was she free of these mysterious
restraints.

He had spent the morning alone in his extremely dingy room in Brixton
photographing Circus documents, having first drawn a subminiature camera
from his own operational stores, a thing he did quite often to keep his hand in.
“Daylight or electric?” the storeman asked, and they had a friendly discussion
about film grain. He told his secretary he didn’t want to be disturbed, closed his
door, and set to work according to Smiley’s precise instructions. The windows
were high in the wall. Even sitting, he could see only the sky and the tip of the
new school up the road.

He began with works of reference from his personal safe. Smiley had given
him priorities. First the staff directory, on issue to senior officers only, which
supplied the home addresses, telephone numbers, names, and worknames of all
home-based Circus personnel. Second, the handbook on staff duties, including
the fold-in diagram of the Circus’s reorganisation under Alleline. At its centre
lay Bill Haydon’s London Station, like a giant spider in its own web. “After the
Prideaux fiasco,” Bill had reputedly fumed, “we’ll have no more damned private
armies, no more left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.” Alleline,
he noticed, was billed twice: once as Chief, once as Director Special Sources.
According to rumour, it was those sources that kept the Circus in business.
Nothing else, in Guillam’s view, could account for the Circus’s inertia at
working level and the esteem it enjoyed in Whitehall. To these documents, at
Smiley’s insistence, he added the scalp-hunters’ revised charter, in the form of an
Alleline letter beginning “Dear Guillam,” and setting out in detail the diminution
of his powers. In several cases, the winner was Toby Esterhase, head of Acton

lamplighters, the one outstation that had actually grown fatter under lateralism.

Next he moved to his desk and photographed, also on Smiley’s instruction, a
handful of routine circulars that might be useful as background reading. These
included a belly-ache from Admin., on the state of safe houses in the London
area (“Kindly treat them as if they were your own ”), and another about the
misuse of unlisted Circus telephones for private calls. Lastly a very rude
personal letter from documents warning him “for the last time of asking” that his
workname driving licence was out of date, and that unless he took the trouble to
renew it “his name would be forwarded to the housekeepers for appropriate
disciplinary action.”

He put away the camera and returned to his safe. On the bottom shelf lay a
stack of lamplighter reports issued over Toby Esterhase’s signature and stamped
with the code word “Hatchet.” These supplied the names and cover jobs of the
two or three hundred identified Soviet intelligence officers operating in London
under legal or semi-legal cover: trade, Tass, Aeroflot, Radio Moscow, consular,
and diplomatic. Where appropriate, they also gave the dates of lamplighter
investigations and names of branch lines, which is jargon for contacts thrown up
in the course of surveillance and not necessarily run to earth. The reports came
in a main annual volume and monthly supplements. He consulted the main
volume first, then the supplements. At eleven-twenty he locked his safe, rang
London Station on the direct line, and asked for Lauder Strickland, of Banking
Section.

“Lauder, this is Peter from Brixton; how’s trade?”

“Yes, Peter, what can we do for you?”

Brisk and blank. We of London Station have more important friends, said the
tone.

It was a question of washing some dirty money, Guiham explained, to finance
a ploy against a French diplomatic courier who seemed to be for sale. In his
meekest voice, he wondered whether Lauder could possibly find the time for
them to meet and discuss it. Was the project cleared with London Station, Lauder
demanded. No, but Guiham had already sent the papers to Bill by shuttle. Lauder
Strickland came down a peg. Guiham pressed his cause: “There are one or two
tricky aspects, Lauder; I think we need your sort of brain.”

Lauder said he could spare him half an hour.

On his way to the West End, he dropped his films at the meagre premises of a
chemist called Eark, in the Gharing Gross Road. Eark, if it was he, was a very fat
man with tremendous fists. The shop was empty.

“Mr. Lampton’s films, to be developed,” said Guiham. Lark took the package
to the back room, and when he returned he said “Ah done” in a gravel voice.

then blew out a lot of air at once, as if he were smoking, which he wasn’t. He
saw Guillam to the door and closed it behind him with a clatter. Where on God’s
earth does George find them, Guillam wondered. He had bought some throat
pastilles. Every move must be accountable, Smiley had warned him: assume that
the Gircus has the dogs on you twenty-four hours a day. So what’s new about
that, Guillam thought; Toby Esterhase would put the dogs on his own mother if it
bought him a pat on the back from Alleline.

From Gharing Gross he walked up to Ghez Victor for lunch with his head
man, Gy Vanhofer, and a thug calling himself Eorimer, who claimed to be
sharing his mistress with the East German ambassador in Stockholm. Eorimer
said the girl was ready to play ball but she needed British citizenship and a lot of
money on delivery of the first take. She would do anything, he said: spike the
ambassador’s mail, bug his rooms, or “put broken glass in his bath,” which was
supposed to be a joke. Guillam reckoned Eorimer was lying, and he was inclined
to wonder whether Vanhofer was too, but he was wise enough to realise that he
was in no state to say which way anyone was leaning just then. He liked Ghez
Victor but had no recollection of what he ate, and now as he entered the lobby of
the Gircus he knew the reason was excitement.

“Hullo, Bryant.”

“Nice to see you, sir. Take a seat, sir, please, just for a moment, sir, thank
you,” said Bryant, all in one breath, and Guillam perched on the wooden settle
thinking of dentists and Gamilla. She was a recent and somewhat mercurial
acquisition; it was a while since things had moved quite so fast for him. They
met at a party and she talked about truth, alone in a corner over a carrot juice.
Guillam, taking a long chance, said he wasn’t too good at ethics, so why didn’t
they just go to bed together? She considered for a while, gravely; then fetched
her coat. She’d been hanging around ever since, cooking nut rissoles and playing
the flute.

The lobby looked dingier than ever. Three old lifts, a wooden barrier, a poster
for Mazawattee tea, Bryant’s glass-fronted sentry box with a “Scenes of
England” calendar, and a line of mossy telephones.

“Mr. Strickland is expecting you, sir,” said Bryant as he emerged, and in slow
motion stamped a pink chit with the time of day: “14:55, P. Bryant, Janitor.” The
grille of the centre lift rattled like a bunch of dry sticks.

“Time you oiled this thing, isn’t it?” Guillam called as he waited for the
mechanism to mesh.

“We keep asking,” said Bryant, embarking on a favourite lament. “They never
do a thing about it. You can ask till you’re blue in the face. How’s the family,
sir?”

“Fine,” said Guillam, who had none.

“That’s right,” said Bryant. Looking down, Guillam saw the creamy head
vanish between his feet. Mary called him strawberry and vanilla, he
remembered: red face, white hair, and mushy.

In the lift he examined his pass. “Permit to enter L.S.,” ran the headline.
“Purpose of visit: Banking Section. This document to be handed back on
leaving.” And a space, marked “host’s signature,” blank.

“Well met, Peter. Greetings. You’re a trifle late, I think, but never mind.”

Lauder was waiting at the barrier—all five foot nothing of him, white collared
and secretly on tiptoe—to be visited. In Gontrol’s day this floor had been a
thoroughfare of busy people. Today a barrier closed the entrance and a rat-faced
janitor scrutinised his pass.

“Good God, how long have you had that monster?” Guillam asked, slowing
down before a shiny new coffee machine. A couple of girls, filling beakers,
glanced round and said “Hullo, Lauder,” looking at Guillam. The tall one
reminded him of Gamilla: the same slow-burning eyes, censuring male
insufficiency.

“Ah, but you’ve no notion how many man-hours it saves!” Lauder cried at
once. “Fantastic. Quite fantastic,” and all but knocked over Bill Haydon in his
enthusiasm.

He was emerging from his room, an hexagonal pepper pot overlooking New
Gompton Street and the Gharing Gross Road. He was moving in the same
direction as they were but at about half a mile an hour, which for Bill indoors
was full throttle. Outdoors was a different matter; Guillam had seen that, too—
on training games at Sarratt, and once on a night drop in Greece. Outdoors he
was swift and eager; his keen face, in this clammy corridor shadowed and
withdrawn, seemed in the free air to be fashioned by the outlandish places where
he had served. There was no end to them: no operational theatre, in Guillam’s
admiring eyes, that did not bear the Haydon imprint somewhere. Over and again
in his own career, he had made the same eerie encounter with Bill’s exotic
progress. A year or two back, still working on Marine intelligence and having as
one of his targets the assembly of a team of coast-watchers for the Ghinese ports
of Wenchow and Amoy, Guillam discovered to his amazement that there were
actually Ghinese stay-behind agents living in those very towns, recruited by Bill
Haydon in the course of some forgotten wartime exploit, rigged out with cached
radios and equipment, with whom contact might be made. Another time, raking
through war records of Gircus strong-arm men, more out of nostalgia for the
period than present professional optimism, Guillam stumbled twice on Haydon’s
workname in as many minutes: in 1941 he was running French fishing smacks

out of the Helford Estuary; in the same year, with Jim Prideaux as his stringer, he
was laying down courier lines across southern Europe from the Balkans to
Madrid. To Guillam, Haydon was of that unrepeatable, fading Circus generation,
to which his parents and George Smiley also belonged—exclusive and, in
Haydon’s case, blue-blooded—which had lived a dozen leisured lives to his own
hasty one, and still, thirty years later, gave the Circus its dying flavour of
adventure.

Seeing them both, Haydon stood rock-still. It was a month since Guillam had
spoken to him; he had probably been away on unexplained business. Now,
against the light of his own open doorway, he looked strangely black and tall. He
was carrying something—Guillam could not make out what it was—a magazine,
a file, or a report; his room, split by his own shadow, was an undergraduate
mayhem, monkish and chaotic. Reports, flimsies, and dossiers lay heaped
everywhere; on the wall a baize noticeboard jammed with postcards and press
cuttings; beside it, askew and unframed, one of Bill’s old paintings, a rounded
abstract in the hard flat colours of the desert.

“Hullo, Bill,” said Guillam.

Leaving his door open—a breach of housekeeper regulations—Haydon fell in
ahead of them, still without a word. He was dressed with his customary
dottiness. The leather patches of his jacket were stitched on like diamonds, not
squares, which from behind gave him a harlequin look. His spectacles were
jammed up into his hair like goggles. For a moment they followed him
uncertainly, till, without warning, he suddenly turned himself round, all of him at
once like a statue being slowly swivelled on its plinth, and fixed his gaze on
Guillam. Then he grinned, so that his crescent eyebrows went straight up like a
clown’s, and his face became handsome and absurdly young.

“What the hell are you doing here, you pariah?” he enquired pleasantly.

Taking the question seriously, Lauder started to explain about the Frenchman
and the dirty money.

“Well, mind you lock up the spoons,” said Bill, talking straight through him.
“Those bloody scalp-hunters will steal the gold out of your teeth. Lock up the
girls, too,” he added as an afterthought, his eyes still on Guillam, “if they’ll let
you. Since when did scalp-hunters wash their own money? That’s our job.”

“Lauder’s doing the washing. We’re just spending the stuff.”

“Papers to me,” Haydon said to Strickland, with sudden curtness. “I’m not
crossing any more bloody wires.”

“They’re already routed to you,” said Guillam. “They’re probably in your in-
tray now.”

A last nod sent them on ahead, so that Guillam felt Haydon’s pale blue gaze

boring into his back all the way to the next dark turning.

“Fantastic fellow,” Lauder declared, as if Guillam had never met him.

“London Station could not be in better hands. Incredible ability. Incredible
record. Brilliant.”

Whereas you, thought Guillam savagely, are brilliant by association. With
Bill, with the coffee machine, with banks. His meditations were interrupted by
Roy Bland’s caustic cockney voice, issuing from a doorway ahead of them.

“Hey, Lauder, hold on a minute: have you seen Bloody Bill anywhere? He’s
wanted urgently.”

Followed at once by Toby Esterhase’s faithful mid-European echo from the
same direction: “Immediately, Lauder; actually, we have put out an alert for
him.”

They had entered the last cramped corridor. Lauder was perhaps three paces
on and was already composing his answer to this question as Guillam arrived at
the open doorway and looked in. Bland was sprawled massively at his desk. He
had thrown off his jacket and was clutching a paper. Arcs of sweat ringed his
armpits. Tiny Toby Esterhase was stooped over him like a headwaiter, a stiff-
backed miniature ambassador with silvery hair and a crisp unfriendly jaw, and he
had stretched out one hand towards the paper as if to recommend a speciality.
They had evidently been reading the same document when Bland caught sight of
Lauder Strickland passing.

“Indeed I have seen Bill Haydon,” said Lauder, who had a trick of rephrasing
questions to make them sound more seemly. “I suspect Bill is on his way to you
this moment. He’s a way back there down the corridor; we were having a brief
word about a couple of things.”

Bland’s gaze moved slowly to Guillam and settled there; its chilly appraisal
was uncomfortably reminiscent of Haydon’s. “Hullo, Pete,” he said. At this.

Tiny Toby straightened up and turned his eyes also directly towards Guillam;
brown and quiet like a pointer’s.

“Hi,” said Guillam, “what’s the joke?”

Their greeting was not merely frosty; it was downright hostile. Guillam had
lived cheek by jowl with Toby Esterhase for three months on a very dodgy
operation in Switzerland and Toby had never smiled once, so his stare came as
no surprise. But Roy Bland was one of Smiley’s discoveries, a warmhearted and
impulsive fellow for that world, red-haired and burly, an intellectual primitive
whose idea of a good evening was talking Wittgenstein in the pubs round
Kentish Town. He’d spent ten years as a Party hack, plodding the academic
circuit in Eastern Europe, and now, like Guillam, he was grounded, which was
even something of a bond. His usual style was a big grin, a slap on the shoulder.

and a blast of last night’s beer; but not today.

“No joke, Peter, old boy,” said Roy, mustering a belated smile. “Just surprised
to see you, that’s all. We’re used to having this floor to ourselves.”

“Here’s Bill,” said Lauder, very pleased to have his prognostication so
promptly confirmed. In a strip of light, as he entered it, Guillam noticed the
queer colour of Haydon’s cheeks. A blushing red, daubed high on the bones, but
deep, made up of tiny broken veins. It gave him, thought Guillam in his
heightened state of nervousness, a slightly Dorian Gray look.

His meeting with Lauder Strickland lasted an hour and twenty minutes; Guillam
spun it out that long, and throughout it his mind went back to Bland and
Esterhase and he wondered what the hell was eating them.

“Well, I suppose I’d better go and clear all this with the Dolphin,” he said at
last. “We all know how she is about Swiss banks.” The housekeepers lived two
doors down from Banking. “I’ll leave this here,” he added and tossed the pass on
to Lauder’s desk.

Diana Dolphin’s room smelt of fresh deodorant; her chain-mail handbag lay
on the safe beside a copy of the Financial Times. She was one of those groomed
Gircus brides whom no one ever marries. Yes, he said wearily, the operational
papers were already on submission to London Station. Yes, he understood that
freewheeling with dirty money was a thing of the past.

“Then we shall look into it and let you know,” she announced, which meant
she would go and ask Phil Porteous, who sat next door.

“I’ll tell Lauder, then,” said Guillam, and left.

Move, he thought.

In the men’s room he waited thirty seconds at the basins, watching the door in
the mirror and listening. A curious quiet had descended over the whole floor.
Gome on, he thought, you’re getting old; move. He crossed the corridor, stepped
boldly into the duty officers’ room, closed the door with a slam, and looked
round. He reckoned he had ten minutes, and he reckoned that a slammed door
made less noise in that silence than a door surreptitiously closed. Move.

He had brought the camera but the light was awful. The net-curtained window
looked onto a courtyard full of blackened pipes. He couldn’t have risked a
brighter bulb even if he’d had one with him, so he used his memory. Nothing
much seemed to have changed since the takeover. In the daytime the place was
used as a restroom for girls with the vapours, and to judge by the smell of cheap
scent it still was. Along one wall lay the imitation-leather divan, which at night
made into a rotten bed; beside it the first-aid chest with the red cross peeling off
the front, and a clapped-out television. The steel cupboard stood in its same

place between the switchboard and the locked telephones, and he made a beeline
for it. It was an old cupboard and he could have opened it with a tin opener. He
had brought his picks and a couple of light alloy tools. Then he remembered that
the combination used to be 31-22-11 and he tried it, four anti, three clock, two
anti, clockwise till she springs. The dial was so jaded it knew the way. When he
opened the door, dust rolled out of the bottom in a cloud, crawled a distance,
then slowly lifted towards the dark window. At the same moment, he heard what
sounded like a single note played on a flute: it came from a car, most likely,
braking in the street outside; or the wheel of a file trolley squeaking on linoleum.
But for that moment it was one of those long, mournful notes which made up
Camilla’s practice scales. She played exactly when she felt like it. At midnight,
in the early morning, or whenever. She didn’t give a damn about the neighbours;
she seemed quite nerveless altogether. He remembered her that first evening:
“Which is your side of the bed? Where shall I put my clothes?” He prided
himself on his delicate touch in such things, but Camilla had no use for it;
technique was already a compromise, a compromise with reality—she would say
an escape from it. All right, so get me out of this lot.

The duty logbooks were on the top shelf, in bound volumes with the dates
pasted on the spines. They looked like family account books. He took down the
volume for April and studied the list of names on the inside cover, wondering
whether anyone could see him from the dupe-room across the courtyard, and if
they could, would they care? He began working through the entries, searching
for the night of the tenth and eleventh, when the signals traffic between London
Station and Tarr was supposed to have taken place. Hong Kong was eight hours
ahead, Smiley had pointed out: Tarr’s telegram and London’s first answer had
both happened out of hours.

From the corridor came a sudden swell of voices, and for a second he even
fancied he could pick out Alleline’s growling border brogue lifted in humourless
banter, but fancies were two a penny just now. He had a cover story and a part of
him believed it already. If he was caught, the whole of him would believe it; and
if the Sarratt inquisitors sweated him, he had a fallback—he never travelled
without one. All the same, he was terrified. The voices died, and the ghost of
Percy Alleline with them. Sweat was running over his ribs. A girl tripped past
humming a tune from Hair. If Bill hears you, he’ll murder you, he thought; if
there’s one thing that sends Bill spare it’s humming. “What are you doing here,
you pariah?”

Then, to his fleeting amusement, he actually heard Bill’s infuriated roar,
echoing from God knows what distance: “Stop that moaning. Who is the fool?”

Move. Once you stop, you never start again: there is a special stage-fright that

can make you dry up and walk away, that burns your fingers when you touch the
goods and turns your stomach to water. Move. He put back the April volume and
drew four others at random: February, June, September, and October. He flicked
through them fast, looking for comparisons, returned them to the shelf, and
dropped into a crouch. He wished to God the dust would settle; there seemed to
be no end to it. Why didn’t someone complain? Always the same when a lot of
people use one place: no one’s responsible, no one gives a hoot. He was looking
for the night janitors’ attendance lists. He found them on the bottom shelf,
jammed in with the tea-bags and the condensed milk: sheafs of them in
envelope-type folders. The janitors filled them in and brought them to you twice
in your twelve-hour tour of duty: at midnight and again at 6 A.M. You vouched
for their correctness—God knows how, since the night staff were scattered all
over the building—signed them off, kept the third copy, and chucked it in the
cupboard, no one knew why. That was the procedure before the Flood, and it
seemed to be the procedure now.

Dust and tea-bags on one shelf, he thought. How long since anyone made tea?

Once again he fixed his sights on April lOth-llth. His shirt was clinging to
his ribs. What’s happened to me? Ghrist, I’m over the hill. He turned forward
and back, forward again, twice, three times, then closed the cupboard on the lot.
He waited, listened, took a last worried look at the dust, then stepped boldly
across the corridor, back to the safety of the men’s room. On the way the clatter
hit him: coding machines, the ringing of the telephones, a girFs voice calling
“Where’s that damn float—I had it in my hand,” and that mysterious piping
again, but no longer like Gamilla’s in the small hours. Next time I’ll get her to do
the job, he thought savagely; without compromise, face to face, the way life
should be.

In the men’s room he found Spike Kaspar and Nick de Silsky standing at the
hand basins and murmuring at each other into the mirror: legmen for Haydon’s
Soviet networks, they’d been around for years, known simply as “the Russians.”
Seeing Guillam, they at once stopped talking.

“Hullo, you two. Ghrist, you really are inseparable.”

They were blond and squat and they looked more like Russians than the real
ones. He waited till they’d gone, rinsed the dust off his fingers, then drifted back
to Lauder Strickland’s room.

“Lord save us, that Dolphin does talk,” he said carelessly.

“Very able officer. Nearest thing to indispensable we have around here.
Extremely competent, you can take my word for it,” said Lauder. He looked
closely at his watch before he signed the chit, then led Guillam back to the lifts.
Toby Esterhase was at the barrier, talking to an unfriendly young janitor.

“You are going back to Brixton, Peter?” His tone was casual, his expression as
usual impenetrable.

“Why?”

“I have a car outside, actually. I thought maybe I could run you. We have
some business out that way.”

Run you: Tiny Toby spoke no known language perfectly, but he spoke them
all. In Switzerland, Guillam had heard his French and it had a German accent;
his German had a Slav accent and his English was full of stray flaws and stops
and false vowel sounds.

“It’s all right, Tobe, I think I’ll just go home. Night.”

“Straight home? I would run you, that’s all.”

“Thanks, I’ve got shopping to do. All those bloody godchildren.”

“Sure,” said Toby as if he hadn’t any, and stuck in his little granite jaw in
disappointment.

What the hell does he want, Guillam thought. Tiny Toby and Big Roy, both:
why were they giving me the eye? Was it something they were reading or
something they ate?

Out in the street he sauntered down the Gharing Gross Road peering at the
windows of the bookshops while his other mind checked both sides of the
pavement. It had turned much colder, a wind was getting up, and there was a
promise to people’s faces as they bustled by. He felt elated. Till now he had been
living too much in the past, he decided. Time to get my eye in again. In
Zwemmer’s he examined a coffee-table book called Musical Instruments Down
the Ages and remembered that Gamilla had a late lesson with Dr. Sand, her flute-
teacher. He walked back as far as Foyle’s, glancing down bus queues as he went.
Think of it as abroad, Smiley had said. Remembering the duty room and Roy
Bland’s fishy stare, Guillam had no difficulty. And Bill, too: was Haydon party
to their same suspicion? No. Bill was his own category, Guillam decided, unable
to resist a surge of loyalty to Haydon. Bill would share nothing that was not his
own in the first place. Set beside Bill, those other two were pygmies.

In Soho he hailed a cab and asked for Waterloo Station. At Waterloo, from a
reeking phone box, he telephoned a number in Mitcham, Surrey, and spoke to an
Inspector Mendel, formerly of Special Branch, known to both Guillam and
Smiley from other lives. When Mendel came on the line, Guillam asked for
Jenny and heard Mendel tell him tersely that no Jenny lived there. He apologised
and rang off. He dialed the time and feigned a pleasant conversation with the
automatic announcer because there was an old lady outside waiting for him to
finish. By now he should be there, he thought. He rang off and dialed a second
number in Mitcham, this time a call-box at the end of Mendel’s avenue.

“This is Will,” said Guillam.

“And this is Arthur,” said Mendel cheerfully. “How’s Will?” He was a
quirkish, loping tracker of a man, sharp-faced and sharp-eyed, and Guillam had a
very precise picture of him just then, leaning over his policeman’s notebook with
his pencil poised.

“1 want to give you the headlines now in case 1 go under a bus.”

“That’s right. Will,” said Mendel consolingly. “Gan’t be too careful.”

He gave his message slowly, using the scholastic cover they had agreed on as
a last protection against random interception: exams, students, stolen papers.
Each time he paused, he heard nothing but a faint scratching. He imagined
Mendel writing slowly and legibly and not speaking till he had it all down.

“1 got those happy snaps from the chemist, by the by,” said Mendel finally,
when he had checked it all back. “Gome out a treat. Not a miss among them.”

“Thanks. I’m glad.”

But Mendel had already rung off.

I’ll say one thing for moles, thought Guillam: it’s a long dark tunnel all the
way. As he held open the door for the old lady, he noticed the telephone receiver
lying on its cradle, how the sweat crawled over it in drips. He considered his
message to Mendel; he thought again of Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase staring
at him through the doorway; he wondered quite urgently where Smiley was, and
whether he was taking care. He returned to Eaton Place needing Gamilla badly,
and a little afraid of his reasons. Was it really age that was against him suddenly?
Somehow, for the first time in his life, he had sinned against his own notions of
nobility. He had a sense of dirtiness, even of self-disgust.

12

There are old men who go back to Oxford and find their youth beckoning to
them from the stones. Smiley was not one of them. Ten years ago he might have
felt a pull. Not now. Passing the Bodleian, he vaguely thought, I worked there.
Seeing the house of his old tutor in Parks Road, he remembered that before the
war in its long garden Jebedee had first suggested he might care to talk to “one
or two people I know in London.” And hearing Tom Tower strike the evening
six, he found himself thinking of Bill Haydon and Jim Prideaux, who must have
arrived here the year that he went down, and were then gathered up by the war;
and he wondered idly how they must have looked together then; Bill, the painter,
polemicist, and socialite; Jim, the athlete, hanging on his words. In their heyday
together in the Circus, he reflected, that distinction had all but evened out: Jim
grew nimble at the brainwork and Bill in the field was no man’s fool. Only at the
end, the old polarity asserted itself: the workhorse went back to his stable, the
thinker to his desk.

Spots of rain were falling but he couldn’t see them. He had travelled by rail
and walked from the station, making detours all the way: Blackwell’s, his old
college, anywhere, then north. Dusk had come here early because of the trees.

Reaching a cul-de-sac, he once more dawdled, once more took stock. A
woman in a shawl rode past him on a push-bike, gliding through the beams of
the streetlamps where they pierced the swathes of mist. Dismounting, she pulled
open a gate and vanished. Across the road a muffled figure was walking a dog—
man or woman, he couldn’t tell. Otherwise the road was empty, so was the phone
box. Then abruptly two men passed him, talking loudly about God and war. The
younger one did most of the talking. Hearing the older one agree, Smiley
supposed he was the don.

He was following a high paling that bulged with shrubs. The gate of number
15 was soft on its hinges, a double gate but only one side used. When he pushed
it, the latch was broken. The house stood a long way back; most of the windows
were lit. In one, high up, a young man stooped over a desk. At another, two girls
seemed to be arguing; at a third, a very pale woman was playing the viola but he
couldn’t hear the sound. The ground-floor windows were also lit but the curtains
were drawn. The porch was tiled, the front door panelled with stained glass; on
the jamb was pinned an old notice: “After 11 P.M. use side door only.” Over the
bells, more notices: “Prince, three rings,” “Lumby, two rings,” “Buzz: out all
evening, see you, Janet.” The bottom bell said “Sachs” and he pressed it. At once

dogs barked and a woman started yelling.

“Flush, you stupid boy, it’s only a dunderhead. Flush, shut up, you fool.
Flush!”

The door opened part way, held on a chain; a body swelled into the opening.
While Smiley in the same instant gave his whole effort to seeing who else was
inside the house, two shrewd eyes, wet like a baby’s, appraised him, noted his
briefcase and his spattered shoes, flickered upward to peer past his shoulder
down the drive, then once more looked him over. Finally the white face broke
into a charming smile, and Miss Connie Sachs, formerly queen of research at the
Circus, registered her spontaneous joy.

“George Smiley,” she cried, with a shy trailing laugh as she drew him into the
house. “Why, you lovely darling man, I thought you were selling me a Hoover,
bless you, and all the time it’s George!”

She closed the door after him, fast.

She was a big woman, bigger than Smiley by a head. A tangle of white hair
framed her sprawling face. She wore a brown jacket like a blazer and trousers
with elastic at the waist and she had a low belly like an old man’s. A coke fire
smouldered in the grate. Cats lay before it and a mangy grey spaniel, too fat to
move, lounged on the divan. On a trolley were the tins she ate from and the
bottles she drank from. From the same adapter she drew power for her radio, her
electric ring, and her curling tongs. A boy with shoulder-length hair lay on the
floor, making toast. Seeing Smiley, he put down his brass trident.

“Oh, Jingle, darling, could it be tomorrow?” Connie implored. “It’s not often
my oldest, oldest lover comes to see me.” He had forgotten her voice. She played
with it constantly, pitching it at all odd levels. “I’ll give you a whole free hour,
dear, all to himself: will you? One of my dunderheads,” she explained to Smiley,
long before the boy was out of earshot. “I still teach, I don’t know why.

George, ” she murmured, watching him proudly across the room as he took the
sherry bottle from his briefcase and filled two glasses. “Of all the lovely darling
men I ever knew. He walked, ” she explained to the spaniel. “Look at his boots.
Walked all the way from London, didn’t you, George? Oh, bless, God bless.”

It was hard for her to drink. Her arthritic fingers were turned downward, as if
they had all been broken in the same accident, and her arm was stiff. “Did you
walk alone, George?” she asked, fishing a loose cigarette from her blazer pocket.
“Not accompanied, were we?”

He lit the cigarette for her and she held it like a peashooter, fingers along the
top, then watched him down the line of it with her shrewd, pinkish eyes. “So
what does he want from Connie, you bad boy?”

“Her memory.”

“What part?”

“We’re going back over some old ground.”

“Hear that, Flush?” she yelled to the spaniel. “First they chuck us out with an
old bone, then they come begging to us. Which ground, George?”

“I’ve brought a letter for you from Lacon. He’ll be at his club this evening at
seven. If you’re worried, you’re to call him from the phone box down the road.
I’d prefer you not to do that, but if you must he’ll make the necessary impressive
noises.”

She had been holding him, but now her hands flopped to her sides and for a
good while she floated round the room, knowing the places to rest and the holds
to steady her, and cursing, “Oh, damn George Smiley and all who sail in him.”
At the window, perhaps out of habit, she parted the edge of the curtain but there
seemed to be nothing to distract her.

“Oh, George, damn you so,” she muttered. “How could you let a Lacon in?
Might as well let in the competition, while you’re about it.”

On the table lay a copy of the day’s Times, crossword uppermost. Each square
was inked in laboured letters. There were no blanks.

“Went to the soccer today,” she sang from the dark under the stairs as she
cheered herself up from the trolley. “Lovely Will took me. My favourite
dunderhead, wasn’t that super of him?” Her little-girl voice; it went with an
outrageous pout: “Gonnie got cold, George. Froze solid, Gonnie did, toes an’
all.”

He guessed she was crying, so he fetched her from the dark and led her to the
sofa. Her glass was empty and he filled it half. Side by side on the sofa, they
drank while Gonnie’s tears ran down her blazer onto his hands.

“Oh, George,” she said. “Do you know what she told me when they threw me
out? That personnel cow?” She was holding one point of Smiley’s collar,
working it between her finger and thumb while she cheered up. “You know what
the cow said?” Her sergeant-major voice: “ 'You’re losing your sense of
proportion, Gonnie. It’s time you got out into the real world.’ I hate the real
world, George. I like the Gircus and all my lovely boys.” She took his hands,
trying to interlace her fingers with his.

“Polyakov,” he said quietly, pronouncing it in accordance with Tarr’s
instruction. “Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, cultural attache, Soviet
Embassy, London. He’s come alive again, just as you predicted.”

A car was drawing up in the road; he heard only the sound of the wheels, the
engine was already switched off. Then footsteps, very lightly.

“Janet, smuggling in her boyfriend,” Connie whispered, her pink-rimmed eyes
fixed on his while she shared his distraction. “She thinks I don’t know. Hear
that? Metal quarters on his heels. Now, wait.” The footsteps stopped, there was a
small scuffle. “She’s giving him the key. He thinks he works it more quietly than
she can. He can’t.” The lock turned with a heavy snap. “Oh, you men,” Connie
breathed with a hopeless smile. “Oh, George. Why do you have to drag up
Aleks?” And for a while she wept for Aleks Polyakov.

Her brothers were dons, Smiley remembered; her father was a professor of
something. Control had met her at bridge and invented a job for her.

She began her story like a fairy-tale: “Once upon a time, there was a defector
called Stanley, way back in 1963,” and she applied to it the same spurious logic
—part inspiration, part intellectual opportunism—born of a wonderful mind that
had never grown up. Her formless white face took on the grandmother’s glow of
enchanted reminiscence. Her memory was as compendious as her body and
surely she loved it more, for she had put everything aside to listen to it: her
drink, her cigarette, even for a while Smiley’s passive hand. She sat no longer
slouched but strictly, her big head to one side as she dreamily plucked the white
wool of her hair. He had assumed she would begin at once with Polyakov, but
she began with Stanley; he had forgotten her passion for family trees. Stanley,
she said; the inquisitors’ cover name for a fifth-rate defector from Moscow
Centre. March, 1963. The scalp-hunters bought him second-hand from the Dutch
and shipped him to Sarratt, and probably if it hadn’t been the silly season and if
the inquisitors hadn’t happened to have time on their hands—well, who knows
whether any of it would ever have come to light? As it was. Brother Stanley had
a speck of gold on him, one teeny speck, and they found it. The Dutch missed it
but the inquisitors found it, and a copy of their report came to Connie, “which
was a whole other miracle in itself,” Connie bellowed huffily, “considering that
everyone, and specially Sarratt, made an absolute principle of leaving research
off their distribution lists.”

Patiently Smiley waited for the speck of gold, for Connie was of an age where
the only thing a man could give her was time.

Now, Stanley had defected while he was on a mailfist job in The Hague, she
explained. He was by profession an assassin of some sort and had been sent to
Holland to murder a Russian emigre who was getting on Centre’s nerves.

Instead, he decided to give himself up. “Some girl had made a fool of him,” said
Connie with great contempt. “The Dutch set him a honey trap, my dear, and he
barged in with his eyes wide shut.”

To prepare him for the mission, Centre had posted him to one of their training
camps outside Moscow for a brush-up in the black arts: sabotage and silent
killing. The Dutch, when they had him, were shocked by this and made it the
focal point of their interrogation. They put his picture in the newspapers and had
him drawing pictures of cyanide bullets and all the other dreary weaponry Centre
so adored. But at the Nursery the inquisitors knew that stuff by heart, so they
concentrated on the camp itself, which was a new one, not much known: “Sort of
a millionaires’ Sarratt,” she explained. They made a sketch-plan of the
compound, which covered several hundred acres of forest and lakeland, and put
in all the buildings Stanley could remember: laundries, canteens, lecture huts,
ranges, all the dross. Stanley had been there several times and remembered a lot.
They thought they were about finished when Stanley went very quiet. He took a
pencil and in the north west corner he drew five more huts and a double fence
round them for the guard dogs, bless him. These huts were new, said Stanley,
built in the last few months. You reached them by a private road; he had seen
them from a hilltop when he was out walking with his instructor, Milos.
According to Milos (who was Stanley’s friend, said Connie with much
innuendo), they housed a special school recently founded by Karla for training
military officers in conspiracy.

“So, my dear, there we were,” Connie cried. “For years we’d been hearing
rumours that Karla was trying to build a private army of his own inside Moscow
Centre but, poor lamb, he hadn’t the power. We knew he had agents scattered
round the globe, and naturally he was worried that as he grew older and more
senior he wouldn’t be able to manage them alone. We knew that, like everyone
else, he was dreadfully jealous of them and couldn’t bear the idea of handing
them over to the legal residencies in the target countries. Well, naturally he
wouldn’t: you know how he hated residencies—overstaffed, insecure. Same as
he hated the old guard. 'Flat- earthers,’ he called them. Quite right. Well, now he
had the power and he was doing something about it, as any real man would.
March, 1963,” she repeated, in case Smiley had missed the date.

Then nothing, of course. “The usual game: sit on your thumbs, get on with
other work, whistle for a wind.” She sat on them for three years, until Major
Mikhail Fedorovich Komarov, assistant military attache in the Soviet Embassy in
Tokyo, was caught in flagrante taking delivery of six reels of top-secret
intelligence procured by a senior official in the Japanese Defence Ministry.
Komarov was the hero of her second fairy-tale: not a defector but a soldier with
the shoulder boards of the artillery.

“And medals, my dear! Medals galore!”

Komarov himself had to leave Tokyo so fast that his dog got locked in his flat
and was later found starved to death, which was something Connie could not
forgive him for. Whereas Komarov’s Japanese agent was, of course, duly
interrogated and by a happy chance the Circus was able to buy the report from
the Toka.

“Why, George, come to think of it, it was you who arranged the deal!”

With a quaint pout of professional vanity, Smiley conceded that it might well
have been.

The essence of the report was simple. The Japanese defence official was a
mole. He had been recruited before the war in the shadow of the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria, by one Martin Brandt, a German journalist who seemed
to be connected with the Comintern. Brandt, said Connie, was one of Karla’s
names in the nineteen-thirties. Komarov himself had never been a member of the
official Tokyo residency inside the Embassy; he’d worked solo, with one legman
and a direct line to Karla, whose brother officer he had been in the war. Better
still, before he arrived in Tokyo he had attended a special training course at a
new school outside Moscow set up specially for Karla’s handpicked pupils.
“Conclusion,” Connie sang. “Brother Komarov was our first and, alas, not very
distinguished graduate of the Karla training school. He was shot, poor lamb,”
she added, with a dramatic fall of her voice. “They never hang, do they: too
impatient, the little horrors.”

Now Connie had felt able to go to town, she said. Knowing what signs to look
for, she tracked back through Karla’s file. She spent three weeks in Whitehall
with the army’s Moscow-gazers combing Soviet Army posting bulletins for
disguised entries until, from a host of suspects, she reckoned she had three new,
identifiable Karla trainees. All were military men, all were personally acquainted
with Karla, all were ten to fifteen years his junior. She gave their names as
Bardin, Stokovsky, and Viktorov—all colonels.

At the mention of this third name, Smiley’s eyes turned very tired, as if he
were staving off boredom.

“So what became of them all,” he asked.

“Bardin changed to Sokolov, then Rusakov. Joined the Soviet Delegation to
the United Nations in New York. No overt connection with the local residency,
no involvement in bread-and-butter operations, no coat-trailing, no talent-
spotting—a good solid cover job. Still there, for all I know.”

“Stokovsky?”

“Went illegal, set up a photographic business in Paris as Grodescu, French
Rumanian. Formed an affiliate in Bonn, believed to be running one of Karla’s
West German sources from across the border.”

“And the third? Viktorov?”

“Sunk without trace.”

“Oh, dear,” said Smiley, and his boredom seemed to deepen.

“Trained and disappeared off the face of the earth. May have died, of course.
One does tend to forget the natural causes.”

“Oh, indeed,” Smiley agreed; “oh, quite.”

He had that art, from miles and miles of secret life, of listening at the front of
his mind; of letting the primary incidents unroll directly before him while
another, quite separate faculty wrestled with their historical connection. The
connection ran through Tarr to Irina, through Irina to her poor lover who was so
proud of being called Lapin, and of serving one Colonel Gregor Viktorov
“whose workname at the Embassy is Polyakov.” In his memory, these things
were like part of a childhood: he would never forget them.

“Were there photographs, Connie?” he asked glumly. “Did you land physical
descriptions at all?”

“Of Bardin at the United Nations, naturally. Of Stokovsky, perhaps. We had an
old press picture from his soldiering days, but we could never quite nail the
verification.”

“And of Viktorov, who sank without trace?” Still, it might have been any
name. “No pretty picture of him, either?” Smiley asked, going down the room to
fetch more drink.

“Viktorov, Colonel Gregor,” Connie repeated with a fond distracted smile.
“Fought like a terrier at Stalingrad. No, we never had a photograph. Pity. They
said he was yards the best.” She perked up: “Though, of course, we don’t know
about the others. Five huts and a two-year course: well, my dear, that adds up to
a sight more than three graduates after all these years!”

With a tiny sigh of disappointment, as if to say there was nothing so far in that
whole narrative, let alone in the person of Colonel Gregor Viktorov, to advance
him in his laborious quest, Smiley suggested they should pass to the wholly
unrelated phenomenon of Polyakov, Aleksey Aleksandrovich, of the Soviet
Embassy in London, better known to Connie as dear Aleks Polyakov, and
establish just where he fitted into Karla’s scheme of things and why it was that
she had been forbidden to investigate him further.

13

She was much more animated now. Polyakov was not a fairy-tale hero; he was
her lover Aleks, though she had never spoken to him, probably never seen him in
the flesh. She had moved to another seat closer to the reading lamp, a rocking-
chair that relieved certain pains: she could sit nowhere for long. She had tilted
her head back so that Smiley was looking at the white billows of her neck and
she dangled one stiff hand coquettishly, recalling indiscretions she did not regret;
while to Smiley’s tidy mind her speculations, in terms of the acceptable
arithmetic of intelligence, seemed even wilder than before.

“Oh, he was so good,” she said. “Seven long years Aleks had been here
before we even had an inkling. Seven years, my dear, and not so much as a
tickle! Imagine!”

She quoted his original visa application, those nine years ago: Polyakov,
Aleksey Aleksandrovich, graduate of Leningrad State University, cultural
attache with second-secretary rank, married but not accompanied by wife, born
March 3, 1922, in the Ukraine, son of a transporter, early education not supplied.
She ran straight on, a smile in her voice as she gave the lamplighters’ first
routine description: “Height, five foot eleven; heavy build; colour of eyes, green;
colour of hair, black; no other visible distinguishing marks. Jolly giant of a
bloke,” she declared with a laugh. “Tremendous joker. Black tuft of hair, here,
over the right eye. I’m sure he was a bottom pincher, though we never caught
him at it. I’d have offered him one or two bottoms of our own if Toby had played
ball, which he wouldn’t. Not that Aleksey Aleksandrovich would have fallen for
that, mind. Aleks was far too artful,” she said proudly. “Lovely voice. Mellow
like yours. I often used to play the tapes twice, just to listen to him speaking. Is
he really still around, George? I don’t even like to ask, you see. I’m afraid they’ll
all change and I won’t know them any more.”

He was still there, Smiley assured her. The same cover, the same rank.

“And still occupying that dreadful little suburban house in Highgate that
Toby’s watchers hated so? Forty Meadow Close, top floor. Oh, it was a pest of a
place. I love a man who really lives his cover, and Aleks did. He was the busiest
culture vulture that Embassy ever had. If you wanted something done fast—
lecturer, musician, you name it—Aleks cut through the red tape faster than any
man.”

“How did he manage that, Connie?”

“Not how you think, George Smiley,” she sang as the blood shot to her face.

“Oh, no. Aleksey Aleksandrovich was nothing but what he said he was—so
there; you ask Toby Esterhase or Percy Alleline. Pure as the driven snow, he
was. Unbesmirched in any shape or form—Toby will put you right on that!”

“Hey,” Smiley murmured, filling her glass. “Hey, steady, Connie. Come
down.”

“Fooey,” she shouted, quite unmodified. “Sheer unadulterated fooey. Aleksey
Aleksandrovich Polyakov was a six-cylinder Karla-trained hood if ever I saw
one, and they wouldn’t even listen to me! 'You’re seeing spies under the bed,’
says Toby. 'Lamplighters are fully extended,’ says Percy”—her Scottish brogue
—'“We’ve no place for luxuries here.’ Luxuries my foot!” She was crying again.
“Poor George,” she kept saying. “Poor George. You tried to help but what could
you do? You were on the down staircase yourself. Oh, George, don’t go hunting
with the Laeons. Please don’t.”

Gently he guided her back to Polyakov, and why she was so sure he was
Karla’s hood, a graduate of Karla’s special school.

“It was Remembrance Day,” she sobbed. “We photographed his medals
—’course we did.”

Year one again, year one of her seven-year love affair with Aleks Polyakov. The
curious thing was, she said, that she had her eye on him from the moment he
arrived:

“Hullo, I thought. I’m going to have a bit of fun with you.”

Quite why she thought that she didn’t know. Perhaps it was his self-
sufficiency, perhaps it was his poker walk, straight off the parade-ground:

“Tough as a button. Army written all over him.” Or perhaps it was the way he
lived: “He chose the one house in London those lamplighters couldn’t get within
fifty yards of.” Or perhaps it was his work: “There were three cultural attaches
already: two of them were hoods and the only thing the third did was cart the
flowers up to Highgate Cemetery for poor Karl Marx.”

She was a little dazed, so he walked her again, taking the whole weight of her
when she stumbled. Well, she said, at first Toby Esterhase agreed to put Aleks on
the A list and have his Acton lamplighters cover him for random days, twelve
out of every thirty, and each time they followed him he was as pure as the driven
snow.

“My dear, you’d have thought I’d rung him up and told him, 'Aleks
Aleksandrovich, mind your ''p”s and ''q”s because I’m putting Tiny Toby’s dogs
on you. So just you live your cover and no monkey business.’ ”

He went to functions, lectures, strolled in the park, played a little tennis, and
short of giving sweets to the kids he couldn’t have been more respectable.

Connie fought for continued coverage but it was a losing battle. The machinery
ground on and Polyakov was transferred to the B list: to be topped up every six
months or as resources allowed. The six-monthly top-ups produced nothing at
all, and after three years he was graded Persil: investigated in depth and found to
be of no intelligence interest. There was nothing Connie could do, and really she
had almost begun to live with the assessment when one gorgeous November day
lovely Teddy Hankie telephoned her rather breathlessly from the Laundry at
Acton to say Aleks Polyakov had blown his cover and run up his true colours at
last. They were splashed all over the masthead.

“Teddy was an old old chum. Old Circus and a perfect pet; I don’t care if he’s
ninety. He’d finished for the day and was on his way home when the Soviet
Ambassador’s Volga drove past going to the wreath-laying ceremony, carrying
the three service attaches. Three others were following in a second car. One was
Polyakov and he was wearing more medals than a Christmas tree. Teddy shot
down to Whitehall with his camera and photographed them across the street. My
dear, everything was on our side: the weather was perfect, a bit of rain and then
some lovely afternoon sunshine; he could have got the smile on a fly’s backside
at three hundred yards. We blew up the photographs and there they were: two
gallantry and four campaign. Aleks Polyakov was a war veteran and he’d never
told a soul in seven years. Oh, I was excited! I didn’t even need to plot the
campaigns. Toby,’ I said—I rang him straight away—'You just listen to me for a
moment, you Hungarian poison dwarf. This is one of the occasions when ego
has finally got the better of cover. I want you to turn Aleks Aleksandrovich
inside out for me, no “if’s or “but”s. Connie’s little hunch has come home
trumps.’ ”

“And what did Toby say?”

The grey spaniel let out a dismal sigh, and dropped off to sleep again.

“Toby?” Connie was suddenly very lonely. “Oh, Tiny Toby gave me his dead-
fish voice and said Percy Alleline was now head of operations, didn’t he? It was
Percy’s job, not his, to allocate resources. I knew straight away something was
wrong but I thought it was Toby.” She fell silent. “Damn fire,” she muttered
morosely. “You only have to turn your back and it goes out.” She had lost
interest. “You know the rest. Report went to Percy. 'So what?’ Percy says.
'Polyakov used to be in the Russian Army. It was a biggish army and not
everybody who fought in it was Karla’s agent.’ Very funny. Accused me of
unscientific deduction. 'Whose expression is that?’ I said to him. 'It’s not
deduction at all,’ he says, 'it’s induction.’ 'My dear Percy, wherever have you
been learning words like that; you sound just like a beastly doctor or someone.’

My dear, he was cross! As a sop, Toby puts the dogs on Aleks and nothing
happens. 'Spike his house,’ I said. 'His car, everything! Rig a mugging, turn him
inside out, put the listeners on him! Fake a mistaken identity, search him.
Anything, but for God’s sake do something, because it’s a pound to a rouble
Aleks Polyakov is running an English mole!’ So Percy sends for me, all lofty,”—
the brogue again: “ 'You’re to leave Polyakov alone. You’re to put him out of
your silly woman’s mind, do you understand? You and your blasted Polly
what’s-’is-name are becoming a damned nuisance, so lay off him.’ Follows it up
with a rude letter. 'We spoke and you agreed,’ copy to head cow. I wrote, 'yes
repeat no’ on the bottom and sent it back to him.” She switched to her sergeant-
major voice: “ 'You’re losing your sense of proportion, Connie. Time you got
out into the real world.’ ”

Connie was having a hangover. She was sitting again, slumped over her glass.
Her eyes had closed and her head kept falling to one side.

“Oh, God,” she whispered, waking up again. “Oh, my Lordy be.”

“Did Polyakov have a legman?” Smiley asked.

“Why should he? He’s a culture vulture. Culture vultures don’t need legmen.”

“Komarov had one in Tokyo. You said so.”

“Komarov was military,” she said sullenly.

“So was Polyakov. You saw his medals.”

He held her hand, waiting. Lapin the rabbit, she said, clerk driver at the
Embassy, twerp. At first she couldn’t work him out. She suspected him of being
one Ivlov, but she couldn’t prove it and no one would help her anyway. Lapin the
rabbit spent most of his day padding round London looking at girls and not
daring to talk to them. But gradually she began to pick up the connection.
Polyakov gave a reception, Lapin helped pour the drinks. Polyakov was called in
late at night, and half an hour later Lapin turned up presumably to unbutton a
telegram. And when Polyakov flew to Moscow, Lapin the rabbit actually moved
into the Embassy and slept there till he came back. “He was doubling up,” said
Connie firmly. “Stuck out a mile.”

“So you reported that, too?”

“ ’Course I did.”

“And what happened?”

“Connie was sacked and Lapin went home,” Connie said with a giggle.
“Couple of weeks later, Jimmy Prideaux got shot in the bot, George Smiley was
pensioned off, and Control...” She yawned. “Hey, ho,” she said. “Halcyon
days. Landslide. Did I start it, George?”

The fire was quite dead. From somewhere above them came a thud; perhaps it
was Janet and her lover. Gradually, Connie began humming, then swaying to her

own music.

He stayed, trying to cheer her up. He gave her more drink and finally it
brightened her.

“Come on,” she said, “I’ll show you my bloody medals.”

Dormitory feasts again. She had them in a scuffed attache case, which Smiley
had to pull out from under the bed. First a real medal in a box and a typed
citation calling her by her workname Constance Salinger and putting her on the
Prime Minister’s list.

“’Cause Connie was a good girl,” she explained, her cheek against his. “And
loved all her gorgeous boys.”

Then photographs of past members of the Circus: Connie in Wren’s uniform
in the war, standing between Jebedee and old Bill Magnus, the wrangler, taken
somewhere in England; Connie with Bill Haydon one side and Jim Prideaux the
other, the men in cricket gear and all three looking very-nicely-thank-you, as
Connie put it, on a summer course at Sarratt, the grounds stretching out behind
them, mown and sunlit, and the sight screens glistening. Next an enormous
magnifying glass with signatures engraved on the lens: from Roy, from Percy,
from Toby and lots of others, “To Connie with love and never say goodbye!”

Lastly, Bill’s own special contribution: a caricature of Connie lying across the
whole expanse of Kensington Palace Gardens while she peered at the Soviet
Embassy through a telescope: “With love and fond memories, dear, dear
Connie.”

“They still remember him here, you know,” she said. “The golden boy. Christ
Church common-room has a couple of his paintings. They take them out quite
often. Giles Langley stopped me in the High only the other day: did I ever hear
from Haydon? Don’t know what I said: Yes. No. Does Giles’s sister still do safe
houses, do you know?” Smiley did not. “ 'We miss his flair,’ says Giles, 'they
don’t breed them like him any more.’ Giles must be a hundred and eight in the
shade. Says he taught Bill modern history, in the days before 'Empire’ became a
dirty word. Asked after Jim, too. 'His alter ego, we might say, hem hem, hem
hem.’ You never liked Bill, did you?” Connie ran on vaguely, as she packed it all
away again in plastic bags and bits of cloth. “I never knew whether you were
jealous of him or he was jealous of you. Too glamorous, I suppose. You always
distrusted looks. Only in men, mind.”

“My dear Connie, don’t be absurd,” Smiley retorted, off guard for once. “Bill
and I were perfectly good friends. What on earth makes you say that?”

“Nothing.” She had almost forgotten it. “I heard once he had a run round the
park with Ann, that’s all. Isn’t he a cousin of hers, or something? I always
thought you’d have been so good together, you and Bill, if it could have worked.

You’d have brought back the old spirit. Instead of that Scottish twerp. Bill
rebuilding Camelot”—her fairy-tale smile again—“and George—”

“George picking up the bits,” said Smiley, vamping for her, and they laughed,
Smiley falsely.

“Give me a kiss, George. Give Gonnie a kiss.”

She showed him through the kitchen garden, the route her lodgers used; she
said he would prefer it to the view of the filthy new bungalows the Harrison pigs
had flung up in the next door garden. A thin rain was falling, a few stars glowed
big and pale in the mist; on the road lorries rumbled northward through the
night. Glasping him, Gonnie grew suddenly frightened.

“You’re very naughty, George. Do you hear? Look at me. Don’t look that way,
it’s all neon lights and Sodom. Kiss me. All over the world, beastly people are
making our time into nothing; why do you help them? Why?”

“I’m not helping them, Gonnie.”

“’Gourse you are. Look at me. It was a good time, do you hear? A real time.
Englishmen could be proud then. Let them be proud now.”

“That’s not quite up to me, Gonnie.”

She was pulling his face onto her own, so he kissed her full on the lips.

“Poor loves.” She was breathing heavily, not perhaps from any one emotion
but from a whole mess of them, washed around in her like mixed drinks. “Poor
loves. Trained to Empire, trained to rule the waves. All gone. All taken away.
Bye-bye, world. You’re the last, George, you and Bill. And filthy Percy a bit.”
He had known it would end like this; but not quite so awfully. He had had the
same story from her every Ghristmas at the little drinking parties that went on in
corners round the Gircus. “You don’t know Millponds, do you?” she was asking.

“What’s Millponds?”

“My brother’s place. Beautiful Palladian house, lovely grounds, near
Newbury. One day a road came. Grash. Bang. Motorway. Took all the grounds
away. I grew up there, you see. They haven’t sold Sarratt, have they? I was
afraid they might.”

“I’m sure they haven’t.”

He longed to be free of her but she was clutching him more fiercely; he could
feel her heart thumping against him.

“If it’s bad, don’t come back. Promise? I’m an old leopard and I’m too old to
change my spots. I want to remember you all as you were. Lovely, lovely boys.”

He did not like to leave her there in the dark, swaying under the trees, so he
walked her halfway back to the house, neither of them talking. As he went down
the road, he heard her humming again, so loud it was like a scream. But it was
nothing to the mayhem inside him just then, the currents of alarm and anger and

disgust at this blind night walk, with God knew what bodies at the end.

He caught a stopping train to Slough, where Mendel was waiting for him with a
hired car. As they drove slowly towards the orange glow of the city, he listened
to the sum of Peter Guillam’s researches. The duty officers’ ledger contained no
record of the night of April lOth-llth, said Mendel. The pages had been excised
with a razor blade. The janitors’ returns for the same night were also missing, as
were the signals’ returns.

“Peter thinks it was done recently. There’s a note scribbled on the next page,
saying, 'All enquiries to Head of London Station.’ It’s in Esterhase’s handwriting
and dated Friday.”

“Last Friday?” said Smiley, turning so fast that his seat belt let out a whine of
complaint. “That’s the day Tarr arrived in England.”

“It’s all according to Peter,” Mendel replied stolidly.

And finally, concerning Lapin alias Ivlov, and Gultural Attache Aleksey
Aleksandrovich Polyakov, both of the Soviet Embassy in Eondon, Toby
Esterhase’s lamplighter reports carried no adverse trace whatever. Both had been
investigated, both were graded Persil: the cleanest category available. Lapin had
been posted back to Moscow a year ago.

In a briefcase, Mendel had also brought Guillam’s photographs, the result of
his foray at Brixton, developed and blown up to full-plate size. Glose to
Paddington Station, Smiley got out and Mendel held the case out to him through
the doorway.

“Sure you don’t want me to come with you?” Mendel asked.

“Thank you. It’s only a hundred yards.”

“Lucky for you there’s twenty-four hours in the day, then.”

“Yes, it is.”

“Some people sleep.”

“Good night.”

Mendel was still holding onto the briefcase. “I may have found the school,” he
said. “Place called Thursgood’s, near Taunton. He did half a term’s supply work
in Berkshire first, then seems to have hoofed it to Somerset. Got a trailer, I hear.
Want me to check?”

“How will you do that?”

“Bang on his door. Sell him a magazine, get to know him socially.”

“I’m sorry,” said Smiley, suddenly worried. “I’m afraid I’m jumping at
shadows. I’m sorry, that was rude of me.”

“Young Guillam’s jumping at shadows, too,” said Mendel firmly. “Says he’s
getting funny looks around the place. Says there’s something up and they’re all

in it. I told him to have a stiff drink.”

“Yes,” said Smiley after further thought. “Yes, that’s the thing to do. Jim’s a
pro,” he explained. “Afieldman of the old school. He’s good, whatever they did
to him.”

Camilla had come back late. Guillam had understood her flute lesson with Sand
ended at nine, yet it was eleven by the time she let herself in, and he was
accordingly short with her; he couldn’t help it. Now she lay in bed, with her
grey-black hair spread over the pillow, watching him as he stood at the unlit
window staring into the square.

“Have you eaten?” he said.

“Dr. Sand fed me.”

“What on?”

Sand was a Persian, she had told him.

No answer. Dreams, perhaps? Nut steak? Love? In bed she never stirred
except to embrace him. When she slept, she barely breathed; sometimes he
would wake and watch her, wondering how he would feel if she were dead.

“Are you fond of Sand?” he asked.

“Sometimes.”

“Is he your lover?”

“Sometimes.”

“Maybe you should move in with him instead of me.”

“It’s not like that,” said Camilla. “You don’t understand.”

No. He didn’t. First there had been a loving couple necking in the back of a
Rover, then a lonely queer in a trilby exercising his Sealyham; then a girl made
an hour-long call from the phone box outside his front door. There need be
nothing to any of it, except that the events were consecutive, like a changing of
the guard. Now a van had parked and no one got out. More lovers, or a
lamplighters’ night team? The van had been there ten minutes when the Rover
drove away.

Camilla was asleep. He lay awake beside her, waiting for tomorrow when, at
Smiley’s request, he intended to steal the file on the Prideaux affair, otherwise
known as the Ellis scandal or—more locally—Operation Testify.

14

It had been, till that moment, the second happiest day of Bill Roach’s short life.
The happiest was shortly before the dissolution of his household, when his father
discovered a wasps’ nest in the roof and recruited Bill to help him smoke them
out. His father was not an outdoor man—not even handy—but after Bill had
looked up wasps in his encyclopaedia they drove to the chemist together and
bought sulphur, which they burned on a charger under the eave, and did the
wasps to death.

Whereas today had seen the formal opening of Jim Prideaux’s car-club rally.
Till now they had only stripped the Alvis down, refurbished her, and put her
together again, but today, as the reward, they had laid out—with the help of
Latzy, the D.P.—a slalom of straw bales on the stony side of the drive. Then each
in turn had taken the wheel and, with Jim as timekeeper, puffed and shunted
through the gates to the tumult of their supporters. “Best car England ever made”
was how Jim had introduced his car. “Out of production, thanks to Socialism.”
She was now repainted, she had a racing Union Jack on the bonnet, and she was
undoubtedly the finest, fastest car on earth. In the first round. Roach had come
third out of fourteen, and now in the second he had reached the chestnut trees
without once stalling, and was all set for the home lap and a record time. He had
never imagined that anything could give him so much pleasure. He loved the car,
he loved Jim, and he even loved the school, and for the first time in his life he
loved trying to win. He could hear Jim yelling, “Easy, Jumbo,” and he could see
Latzy leaping up and down with the improvised chequered flag; but as he
clattered past the post he already knew that Jim wasn’t watching him any more
but glaring down the course towards the beech trees.

“Sir, how long, sir?” he asked breathlessly, and there was a small hush.

“Timekeeper!” sang Spikely, chancing his luck. “Time, please. Rhino.”

“Was very good, Jumbo,” Latzy said, also looking at Jim.

For once, Spikely’s impertinence, like Roach’s entreaty, found no response.
Jim was staring across the field, towards the lane that formed the eastern border.
Beside him stood a boy named Coleshaw, whose nickname was Cole Slaw. He
was a lag from Three B, and famous for sucking up to staff. The ground lay very
flat just there before lifting to the hills; often after a few days’ rain it flooded. For
this reason there was no good hedge beside the lane but a post-and-wire fence;
and no trees, either—^just the fence, the flats, and sometimes the Quantocks
behind, which today had vanished in the general whiteness. The flats could have

been a marsh leading to a lake, or simply to the white infinity. Against this
washed-out background strolled a single figure, a trim, inconspicuous pedestrian,
male and thin-faced, in a trilby hat and grey raincoat, carrying a walking stick
that he barely used. Watching him also. Roach decided that the man wanted to
walk faster but was going slowly for a purpose.

“Got your specs on, Jumbo?” asked Jim, staring after the man, who was about
to draw level with the next post.

“Yes, sir.”

“Who is he, then? Looks like Solomon Grundy.”

“Don’t know, sir.”

“Never seen him before?”

“No, sir.”

“Not staff, not village. So who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn’t he
look this way, Jumbo? What’s wrong with us? Wouldn’t you, if you saw a bunch
of boys flogging a car round a field? Doesn’t he like cars? Doesn’t he like
boys?”

Roach was still thinking up an answer to all these questions when Jim started
speaking to Latzy in D.R, using a murmured, level sort of tone, which at once
suggested to Roach that there was a complicity between them, a special foreign
bond. The impression was strengthened by Latzy’s reply, plainly negative, which
had the same unstartled quietness.

“Sir, please, sir, I think he’s to do with the church, sir,” said Gole Slaw. “I saw
him talking to Wells Fargo, sir, after chapel.”

The vicar’s name was Spargo and he was very old. It was Thursgood legend
that he was in fact the great Wells Fargo in retirement. At this intelligence, Jim
thought awhile and Roach, furious, told himself that Goleshaw was making the
story up.

“Hear what they talked about, Gole Slaw?”

“Sir, no, sir. They were looking at pew lists, sir. But I could ask Wells Fargo,
sir.”

“Our pew lists? Thursgood pew lists?”

“Yes, sir. School pew lists. Thursgood’s. With all the names, sir, where we
sit.”

And where the staff sit, too, thought Roach sickly.

“Anybody sees him again, let me know. Or any other sinister bodies,
understand?” Jim was addressing them all, making light of it now. “Don’t hold
with odd bods hanging about the school. Last place I was at, we had a whole
damn gang. Gleared the place out. Silver, money, boys’ watches, radios—God
knows what they didn’t pinch. He’ll pinch the Alvis next. Best car England ever

made, and out of production. Colour of hair, Jumbo?”

“Black, sir.”

“Height, Cole Slaw?”

“Sir, six foot, sir.”

“Everybody looks six foot to Cole Slaw, sir,” said a wit, for Coleshaw was a
midget, reputedly fed on gin as a baby.

“Age, Spikely, you toad?”

“Ninety-one, sir.”

The moment dissolved in laughter; Roach was awarded a re-drive and did
badly, and the same night lay in an anguish of jealousy that the entire car club,
not to mention Latzy, had been recruited wholesale to the select rank of watcher.
It was poor consolation to assure himself that their vigilance would never match
his own; that Jim’s order would not outlive the day; or that from now on he must
increase his efforts to meet what was clearly an advancing threat.

The thin-faced stranger disappeared, but next day Jim paid a rare visit to the
churchyard; Roach saw him talking to Wells Fargo before an open grave.
Thereafter Bill Roach noticed a steady darkening of Jim’s face, and an alertness
which at times was like an anger in him, as he stalked through the twilight every
evening, or sat on the hummocks outside his trailer, indifferent to the cold or
wet, smoking his tiny cigar and sipping his vodka as the dusk closed on him.

PART II

15

The Hotel Islay in Sussex Gardens—where, on the day after his visit to Ascot,
George Smiley under the name of Barraclough had set up his operational
headquarters—was a very quiet place, considering its position, and perfectly
suited to his needs. It lay a hundred yards south of Paddington Station, one of a
terrace of elderly mansions cut off from the main avenue by a line of plane trees
and a parking patch. The traffic roared past it all night. But the inside, though it
was a fire-bowl of clashing wallpapers and copper lampshades, was a place of
extraordinary calm. Not only was there nothing going on in the hotel, there was
nothing going on in the world, either, and this impression was strengthened by
Mrs. Pope Graham, the proprietor, a major’s widow with a terribly langorous
voice that imparted a sense of deep fatigue to Mr. Barraclough or anyone else
who sought her hospitality. Inspector Mendel, whose informant she had been for
many years, insisted that her name was plain Graham. The Pope had been added
for grandeur or out of deference to Rome.

“Your father wasn’t a Green Jacket, was he, dear?” she enquired, with a yawn,
as she read Barraclough in the register. Smiley paid her fifty pounds’ advance for
a two-week stay, and she gave him Room 8 because he wanted to work. He
asked for a desk and she gave him a rickety card table; Norman, the boy, brought
it. “It’s Georgian,” she said with a sigh, supervising its delivery. “So you will
love it for me, won’t you, dear? I shouldn’t lend it to you, really; it was the
Major’s.”

To the fifty, Mendel privately had added a further twenty on account, from his
own wallet—“dirty oncers,” as he called them—which he later recovered from
Smiley. “No smell to nothing, is there?” he said.

“You could say so,” Mrs. Pope Graham agreed, demurely stowing the notes
among her nether garments.

“I’ll want every scrap,” Mendel warned, seated in her basement apartment
over a bottle of the one she liked. “Times of entry and exit, contacts, life-style,
and most of all,” he said, lifting an emphatic finger, “most of all—and more
important than you can possibly know, this is—I’ll want suspicious persons
taking an interest or putting questions to your staff under a pretext.” He gave her
his state-of-the-nation look. “Even if they say they’re the Guards Armoured and
Sherlock Holmes rolled into one.”

“There’s only me and Norman,” said Mrs. Pope Graham, indicating a shivery
boy in a black overcoat to which had been stitched a velvet collar of beige. “And

they’ll not get far with Norman—will they, dear; you’re too sensitive.”

“Same with his incoming letters,” said the Inspector. “I’ll want postmarks and
times posted where legible, but no tampering or holding back. Same with his
objects.” He allowed a hush to fall as he eyed the substantial safe that formed
such a feature of the furnishings. “Now and then, he’s going to ask for objects to
be lodged. Mainly they’ll be papers, sometimes books. There’s only one person
allowed to look at those objects apart from him.” He pulled a sudden piratical
grin: “Me. Understand? No one else can even know you’ve got them. And don’t
fiddle with them, or he’ll know because he’s sharp. It’s got to be expert fiddling.
I’m not saying any more,” Mendel concluded. Though he did remark to Smiley,
soon after returning from Somerset, that if twenty quid was all it cost them,
Norman and his protectress were the cheapest baby-sitting service in the
business.

In which boast he was pardonably mistaken, for he could hardly be expected
to know of Jim’s recruitment of the entire car club; or the means by which Jim
was able subsequently to trace the path of Mendel’s wary investigations. Nor
could Mendel, or anyone else, have guessed the state of electric alertness to
which anger, and the strain of waiting, and perhaps a little madness, had
seemingly brought Jim.

Room 8 was on the top floor. Its window looked onto the parapet. Beyond the
parapet lay a side street with a shady bookshop and a travel agency called Wide
World. The hand towel was embroidered “Swan Hotel Marlow.” Lacon stalked
in that evening carrying a fat briefcase containing the first consignment of papers
from his office. To talk, the two men sat side by side on the bed while Smiley
played a transistor wireless to drown the sound of their voices. Lacon took this
mawkishly; he seemed somehow too old for the picnic. Next morning on his way
to work, Lacon reclaimed the papers and returned the books that Smiley had
given him to pad out his briefcase. In this role Lacon was at his worst. His
manner was offended and off-hand; he made it clear he detested the irregularity.
In the cold weather, he seemed to have developed a permanent blush. But Smiley
could not have read the files by day, because they were on call to Laeon’s staff
and their absence would have caused an uproar. Nor did he want to. He knew
better than anyone that he was desperately short of time. Over the next three
days this procedure varied very little. Each evening on his way to take the train
from Paddington, Lacon dropped in his papers, and each night Mrs. Pope
Graham furtively reported to Mendel that the sour gangly one had called again—
the one who looked down his nose at Norman. Each morning, after three hours’
sleep and a disgusting breakfast of undercooked sausage and overcooked tomato

—there was no other menu—Smiley waited for Lacon to arrive, then slipped
gratefully into the cold winter’s day to take his place among his fellow men.

They were extraordinary nights for Smiley, alone up there on the top floor.
Thinking of them afterwards—though his days between were just as fraught, and
on the surface more eventful—he recalled them as a single journey, almost a
single night. “And you’ll do it,” Lacon had piped shamelessly in the garden. “Go
forwards, go backwards?” As Smiley retraced path after path into his own past,
there was no longer any difference between the two: forwards or backwards, it
was the same journey and its destination lay ahead of him. There was nothing in
that room, no object among that whole magpie collection of tattered hotel junk,
that separated him from the rooms of his recollection. He was back on the top
floor of the Circus, in his own plain office with the Oxford prints, just as he had
left it a year ago. Beyond his door lay the low-ceilinged anteroom where
Control’s grey-haired ladies, the mothers, softly typed and answered telephones;
while here in the hotel an undiscovered genius along the corridor night and day
tapped patiently at an old machine. At the anteroom’s far end—in Mrs. Pope
Graham’s world there was a bathroom there, and a warning not to use it—stood
the blank door that led to Control’s sanctuary: an alley of a place, with old steel
cupboards and old red books, a smell of sweet dust and jasmine tea. Behind the
desk Control himself, a carcass of a man by then, with his lank grey forelock and
his smile as warm as a skull.

This mental transposition was so complete in Smiley that when his phone rang
—the extension was an extra, payable in cash—he had to give himself time to
remember where he was. Other sounds had an equally confusing effect on him,
such as the rustle of pigeons on the parapet, the scraping of the television mast in
the wind, and—in rain—the sudden river gurgling in the roof valley. For these
sounds also belonged to his past, and in Cambridge Circus were heard by the
fifth floor only. His ear selected them, no doubt, for that very reason: they were
the background jingle of his past. Once in the early morning, hearing a footfall in
the corridor outside his room, Smiley actually went to the bedroom door
expecting to let in the Circus night coding clerk. He was immersed in Guillam’s
photographs at the time, puzzling out, from far too little information, the likely
Circus procedure under lateralism for handling an incoming telegram from Hong
Kong. But instead of the clerk he found Norman, barefooted in pyjamas.

Confetti was strewn over the carpet and two pairs of shoes stood outside the
opposite door, a man’s and a girl’s, though no one at the Islay—least of all
Norman—would ever clean them.

“Stop prying and go to bed,” said Smiley. And when Norman only stared:

“Oh, do go away, will you? ”—And nearly, but he stopped himself in time, “You

grubby little man.”

“Operation Witchcraft,” read the title on the first volume Lacon had brought to
him that first night. “Policy regarding distribution of Special Product.” The rest
of the cover was obliterated by warning labels and handling instructions,
including one that quaintly advised the accidental finder to “return the file
UNREAD” to the Chief Registrar at the Cabinet Office. “Operation Witchcraft,”
read the second. “Supplementary estimates to the Treasury, special
accommodation in London, special financing arrangements, bounty, etc.”
“Source Merlin,” read the third, bound to the first with pink ribbon. “Customer
Evaluations, cost effectiveness, wider exploitation; see also Secret Annexe.” But
the secret annexe was not attached, and when Smiley asked for it there was a
coldness.

“The Minister keeps it in his personal safe,” Lacon snapped.

“Do you know the combination?”

“Certainly not,” he retorted, now furious.

“What is the title of it?”

“It can be of no possible concern to you. I entirely fail to see why you should
waste your time chasing after this material in the first place. It’s highly secret
and we have done everything humanly possible to keep the readership to the
minimum.”

“Even a secret annexe has to have a title,” said Smiley mildly.

“This has none.”

“Does it give the identity of Merlin?”

“Don’t be ridiculous. The Minister would not want to know, and Alleline
would not want to tell him.”

“What does 'wider exploitation’ mean?”

“I refuse to be interrogated, George. You’re not family any more, you know.
By rights, I should have you specially cleared, as it is.”

“Witchcraft-cleared?”

“Yes.”

“Do we have a list of people who have been cleared in that way?”

It was in the policy file, Lacon retorted, and all but slammed the door on him
before coming back, to the slow chant of “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?”
introduced by an Australian disc-jockey. “The Minister—” He stopped, and
began again. “He doesn’t like devious explanations. He has a saying: he’ll only
believe what can be written on a postcard. He’s very impatient to be given
something he can get his hands on.”

Smiley said, “You won’t forget Prideaux, will you? Just anything you have on

him at all; even scraps are better than nothing.”

With that, Smiley left Lacon to glare awhile, then make a second exit: “You’re
not going fey, are you, George? You realise that Prideaux had most likely never
even heard of Witchcraft before he was shot? I really do fail to see why you
can’t stick with the primary problem instead of rootling around in . . But by
this time he had talked himself out of the room.

Smiley turned to the last of the batch: “Operation Witchcraft, correspondence
with Department.” “Department” being one of Whitehall’s many euphemisms
for the Circus. This volume was conducted in the form of official minutes
between the Minister on the one side, and on the other—recognisable at once by
his laborious schoolboy hand—Percy Alleline, at that time still consigned to the
bottom rungs of Control’s ladder of beings.

A very dull monument, Smiley reflected, surveying these much-handled files,
to such a long and cruel war.

16

It was this long and cruel war that in its main battles Smiley now relived as he
embarked upon his reading. The files contained only the thinnest record of it; his
memory contained far more. Its protagonists were Alleline and Control, its
origins misty. Bill Haydon—a keen, if saddened, follower of those events—
maintained that the two men learned to hate each other at Cambridge during
Control’s brief spell as a don and Alleline’s as an undergraduate. According to
Bill, Alleline was Control’s pupil and a bad one, and Control taunted him, which
he certainly might have.

The story was grotesque enough for Control to play it up: “Percy and I are
blood brothers, I hear. We romped together in punts, imagine!” He never said
whether it was true.

To half-legend of that sort, Smiley could add a few hard facts from his
knowledge of the two men’s early lives. While Control was no man’s child,

Percy Alleline was a lowland Scot and a son of the Manse; his father was a
Presbyterian hammer, and if Percy did not have his faith, he had surely inherited
the faculty of bullish persuasion. He missed the war by a year or two and joined
the Circus from a City company. At Cambridge he had been a bit of a politician
(somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan, said Haydon who was himself. Lord
knows, no milk-and-water liberal) and a bit of an athlete. He was recruited by a
figure of no account called Maston, who for a short time contrived to build
himself a corner in counter-intelligence. Maston saw a great future in Alleline
and, having peddled his name furiously, fell from grace. Finding Alleline an
embarrassment. Circus personnel packed him off to South America, where he
did two full tours under consular cover without returning to England.

Even Control later admitted that Percy did extremely well there, Smiley
recalled. The Argentinians, liking his tennis and the way he rode, took him for a
gentleman—Control speaking—and assumed he was stupid, which Percy never
quite was. By the time he handed over to his successor, he had put together a
string of agents along both seaboards and was spreading his wings northward as
well. After home leave and a couple of weeks’ briefing, he was moved to India,
where his agents seemed to regard him as the reincarnation of the British Raj. He
preached loyalty to them, paid them next to nothing, and—when it suited him—
sold them down the river. From India he went to Cairo. That posting should have
been difficult for Alleline, if not impossible, for the Middle East till then had
been Haydon’s favourite stamping-ground. The Cairo networks looked on Bill

quite literally in the terms which Martindale had used of him that fateful night in
his anonymous dining-club: as a latter-day Lawrence of Arabia. They were all
set to make life hell for his successor. Yet somehow Percy bulldozed his way
through and, if he had only steered clear of the Americans, might have gone
down in memory as a better man than Haydon. Instead there was a scandal and
an open row between Percy and Control.

The circumstances were still obscure: the incident occurred long before
Smiley’s elevation as Control’s high chamberlain. With no authority from
London, it appeared, Alleline had involved himself in a silly American plot to
replace a local potentate with one of their own. Alleline had always had a fatal
reverence for the Americans. From Argentina he had observed with admiration
their rout of left-wing politicians around the hemisphere; in India he had
delighted in their skill at dividing the forces of centralisation. Whereas Control,
like most of the Circus, despised them and all their works, which he frequently
sought to undermine.

The plot aborted, the British oil companies were furious, and Alleline, as the
jargon happily puts it, had to leave in his socks. Later, Alleline claimed that
Control had urged him on, then pulled the rug out from under; even that he had
deliberately blown the plot to Moscow. However it was, Alleline reached
London to find a posting order directing him to the Nursery, where he was to
take over the training of greenhorn probationers. It was a slot normally reserved
for rundown contract men with a couple of years to go before their pension.
There were just so few jobs left in London those days for a man of Percy’s
seniority and talents, explained Bill Haydon, then head of personnel.

“Then you’ll damn well have to invent me one,” said Percy. He was right. As
Bill frankly confessed to Smiley some while later, he had reckoned without the
power of the Alleline lobby.

“But who are these people?” Smiley used to ask. “How can they force a man
on you when you don’t want him?”

“Golfers,” Control snapped. Golfers and conservatives, for Alleline in those
days was flirting with the opposition and was received with open arms, not least
by Miles Sercombe, Ann’s lamentably unremoved cousin and now Lacon’s
Minister. Yet Control had little power to resist. The Circus was in the doldrums
and there was loose talk of scrapping the existing outfit entirely and starting
elsewhere with a new one. Failures in that world occur traditionally in series, but
this had been an exceptionally long run. Product had slumped; more and more of
it had turned out to be suspect. In the places where it mattered. Control’s hand
was none too strong.

This temporary incapacity did not mar Control’s joy in the drafting of Percy

Alleline’s personal charter as Operational Director. He called it Percy’s Fool’s
Cap.

There was nothing Smiley could do. Bill Haydon was in Washington by then,
trying to renegotiate an intelligence treaty with what he called the Fascist
puritans of the American agency. But Smiley had risen to the fifth floor, and one
of his tasks was to keep petitioners off Control’s back. So it was to Smiley that
Alleline came to ask “Why?” Would call on him in his office when Control was
out, invite him to that dismal flat of his, having first sent his paramour to the
cinema, and interrogate him in his plaintive brogue. “Why?” He even invested in
a bottle of a malt whisky, which he forced on Smiley liberally while sticking to
the cheaper brand himself.

“What have I done to him, George, that’s so damn special? We’d a brush or
two—what’s so unusual to that, if you’ll tell me? Why does he pick on me? All I
want is a place at the top table. God knows my record entitles me to that!”

By top table, he meant the fifth floor.

The charter which Control had drafted for him, and which at a glance had a
most impressive shape, gave Alleline the right to examine all operations before
they were launched. The small print made this right conditional upon the consent
of the operational sections, and Control made sure that this was not forthcoming.
The charter invited him to “co-ordinate resources and break down regional
jealousies,” a concept Alleline had since achieved with the establishment of
London Station. But the resources sections, such as the lamplighters, the forgers,
the listeners, and the wranglers, declined to open their books to him and he
lacked the powers to force them. So Alleline starved; his trays were empty from
lunchtime onwards.

“I’m mediocre, is that it? We’ve all to be geniuses these days, prima donnas
and no damn chorus; old men, at that.” For Alleline, though it was easily
forgettable in him, was still a young man to be at the top table, with eight or ten
years to brandish over Haydon and Smiley, and more over Control.

Control was immovable: “Percy Alleline would sell his mother for a
knighthood and this service for a seat in the House of Lords.” And later, as his
hateful illness began creeping over him: “I refuse to bequeath my life’s work to a
parade horse. I’m too vain to be flattered, too old to be ambitious, and I’m ugly
as a crab. Percy’s quite the other way and there are enough witty men in
Whitehall to prefer his sort to mine.”

Which was how, indirectly. Control might be said to have brought Witchcraft
upon his own head.

“George, come in here,” Control snapped one day over the buzzer. “Brother
Percy’s trying to twist my tail. Come in here or there’ll be bloodshed.”

It was a time, Smiley remembered, when unsuccessful warriors were returning
from foreign parts. Roy Bland had just flown in from Belgrade, where with Toby
Esterhase’s help he had been trying to save the wreck of a dying network; Paul
Skordeno, at that time head German, had just buried his best Soviet agent in East
Berlin; and as to Bill, after another fruitless trip he was back in his pepper pot
room fuming about Pentagon arrogance. Pentagon idiocy. Pentagon duplicity,
and claiming that “the time had come to do a deal with the bloody Russians
instead.”

And in the Islay it was after midnight; a late guest was ringing the bell. Which
will cost him ten bob to Norman, thought Smiley, for whom the revised British
coinage was still something of a puzzle. With a sigh, he drew towards him the
first of the Witchcraft files, and, having vouchsafed a gingerly lick to his right
finger and thumb, set to work matching the official memory with his own.

“We spoke,” wrote Alleline, only a couple of months after that interview, in a
slightly hysterical personal letter addressed to Ann’s distinguished cousin the
Minister and entered on Lacon’s file. “Witchcraft reports derive from a source of
extreme sensitivity. To my mind, no existing method of Whitehall distribution
meets the case. The dispatch-box system which we used for GADFLY fell down
when keys were lost by Whitehall customers, or in one disgraceful case when an
overworked Under-Secretary gave his key to his personal assistant. I have
already spoken to Lilley, of naval intelligence, who is prepared to put at our
disposal a special reading-room in the Admiralty main building where the
material is made available to customers and watched over by a senior janitor of
this service. The reading-room will be known, for cover purposes, as the
conference room of the Adriatic Working Party, or the A.W.P. room for short.
Gustomers with reading rights will not have passes, since these also are open to
abuse. Instead they will identify themselves personally to my janitor”—Smiley
noted the pronoun—“who will be equipped with an indoctrination list illustrated
with customers’ photographs.”

Lacon, not yet convinced, to the Treasury through his odious master, the
Minister, on whose behalf his submissions were invariably made:

Even allowing that this is necessary, the reading-room will have to be
extensively rebuilt.

1. Will you authorise cost?

2. If so, the cost should seem to be borne by the Admiralty.

Department will covertly reimburse.

3. There is also the question of extra janitors, a further expense ...

And there is the question of Alleline’s greater glory, Smiley commented as he
slowly turned the pages. It shone already like a beacon everywhere: Percy is
heading for the top table and Control might already be dead.

From the stairwell came the sound of rather beautiful singing. A Welsh guest,
very drunk, was wishing everyone good night.

Witchcraft, Smiley recalled—his memory again, the files knew nothing so
plainly human—Witchcraft was by no means Percy Alleline’s first attempt, in
his new post, at launching his own operation; but since his charter bound him to
obtain Control’s approval, its predecessors had been stillborn. For a while, for
instance, he had concentrated on tunnelling. The Americans had built audio
tunnels in Berlin and Belgrade; the French had managed something similar
against the Americans. Very well, under Percy’s banner the Circus would get in
on the market. Control looked on benignly, an inter-services committee was
formed (known as the Alleline Committee), and a team of boffins from nuts and
bolts made a survey of the foundations of the Soviet Embassy in Athens, where
Alleline counted on the unstinted support of the latest military regime which,
like its predecessors, he greatly admired. Then, very gently. Control knocked
over Percy’s bricks and waited for him to come up with something new. Which,
after several shots between, was exactly what Percy was doing that grey morning
when Control peremptorily summoned Smiley to the feast.

Control was sitting at his desk, Alleline was standing at the window; between
them lay a plain folder, bright yellow and closed.

“Sit over there and take a look at this nonsense.”

Smiley sat in the easy chair and Alleline stayed at the window resting his big
elbows on the sill, staring over the rooftops to Nelson’s Column and the spires of
Whitehall beyond.

Inside the folder was a photograph of what purported to be a high-level Soviet
naval dispatch fifteen pages long.

“Who made the translation?” Smiley asked, thinking that it looked good
enough to be Roy Bland’s work.

“God,” Control replied. “God made it, didn’t he, Percy? Don’t ask him
anything, George, he won’t tell you.”

It was Control’s time for looking exceptionally youthful. Smiley remembered
how Control had lost weight, how his cheeks were pink, and how those who
knew him little tended to congratulate him on his good appearance. Only Smiley,
perhaps, ever noticed the tiny beads of sweat that in those days habitually
followed his hairline.

Precisely, the document was an appreciation, allegedly prepared for the Soviet
High Command, of a recent Soviet naval exercise in the Mediterranean and

Black Sea. In Lacon’s file it was entered simply as Report No. 1, under the title
“Naval.” For months the Admiralty had been screaming at the Circus for
anything relating to this exercise. It therefore had an impressive topicality, which
at once, in Smiley’s eyes, made it suspect. It was detailed but it dealt with
matters that Smiley did not understand even at a distance: shore-to-sea strike
power, radio activation of enemy alert procedures, the higher mathematics of the
balance of terror. If it was genuine it was gold-dust, but there was no earthly
reason to suppose it was genuine. Every week the Circus processed dozens of
unsolicited so-called Soviet documents. Most were straight pedlar material. A
few were deliberate plants by allies with an axe to grind; a few more were
Russian chicken-feed. Very rarely, one turned out to be sound, but usually after it
had been rejected.

“Whose initials are these?” Smiley asked, referring to some annotations
pencilled in Russian in the margin. “Does anyone know?”

Control tilted his head at Alleline. “Ask the authority. Don’t ask me.”

“Zharov,” said Alleline. “Admiral, Black Sea Fleet.”

“It’s not dated,” Smiley objected.

“It’s a draft,” Alleline replied complacently, his brogue richer than usual.
“Zharov signed it Thursday. The finished dispatch with those amendments went
out on circulation Monday, dated accordingly.”

Today was Tuesday.

“Where does it come from?” Smiley asked, still lost.

“Percy doesn’t feel able to tell,” said Control.

“What do our own evaluators say?”

“They’ve not seen it,” said Alleline, “and what’s more they’re not going to.”

Control said icily, “My brother in Christ, Lilley, of naval intelligence, has
passed a preliminary opinion, however, has he not, Percy? Percy showed it to
him last night—over a pink gin, was it, Percy, at the Travellers’?”

“At the Admiralty.”

“Brother Lilley, being a fellow Caledonian of Percy’s, is as a rule sparing in
his praise. However, when he telephoned me half an hour ago he was positively
fulsome. He even congratulated me. He regards the document as genuine and is
seeking our permission—Percy’s, I suppose I should say—to apprise his fellow
sea-lords of its conclusions.”

“Quite impossible,” said Alleline. “It’s for his eyes only, at least for a couple
more weeks.”

“The stuff is so hot,” Control explained, “that it has to be cooled off before it
can be distributed.”

“But where does it come from?” Smiley insisted.

“Oh, Percy’s dreamed up a cover name, don’t you worry. Never been slow on
cover names, have we, Percy?”

“But what’s the access? Who’s the case officer?”

“You’ll enjoy this,” Control promised, aside. He was extraordinarily angry. In
their long association Smiley could not remember him so angry. His slim,
freckled hands were shaking and his normally lifeless eyes were sparkling with
fury.

“Source Merlin,” Alleline said, prefacing the announcement with a slight but
very Scottish sucking of the teeth, “is a highly placed source with access to the
most sensitive levels of Soviet policy-making.” And, as if he were royalty: “We
have dubbed his product 'Witchcraft.’ ”

He had used the identical form of words, Smiley noticed, in a top-secret and
personal letter to a fan at the Treasury, requesting for himself greater discretion
in ad hoc payments to agents.

“He’ll be saying he won him at the football pool next,” Control warned, who
despite his second youth had an old man’s inaccuracy when it came to popular
idiom. “Now get him to tell you why he won’t tell you.”

Alleline was undeterred. He, too, was flushed, but with triumph, not disease.
He filled his big chest for a long speech, which he delivered entirely to Smiley,
tonelessly, rather as a Scottish police sergeant might give evidence before the
courts.

“The identity of Source Merlin is a secret which is not mine to divulge. He’s
the fruit of a long cultivation by certain people in this service. People who are
bound to me, as I am to them. People who are not at all entertained, either, by the
failure rate around this place. There’s been too much blown. Too much lost,
wasted, too many scandals. I’ve said so many times, but I might as well have
spoken to the wind for all the damn care he paid me.”

“He’s referring to me,” Control explained from the sidelines. “I am he in this
speech—you follow, George?”

“The ordinary principles of tradecraft and security have gone to the wall in
this service. Need to know: where is it? Compartmentation at all levels: where is
it, George? There’s too much regional backbiting, stimulated from the top.”

“Another reference to myself,” Control put in.

“Divide and rule, that’s the principle at work these days. Personalities who
should be helping to fight Communism are all at one another’s throats. We’re
losing our top partners.”

“He means the Americans,” Control explained.

“We’re losing our livelihood. Our self-respect. We’ve had enough.” He took
back the report and jammed it under his arm. “We’ve had a bellyful, in fact.”

“And like everyone who’s had enough,” said Control as Adeline noisily left
the room, “he wants more.”

Now for a while Lacon’s files, instead of Smiley’s memory, once more took
up the story. It was typical of the atmosphere of those last months that, having
been brought in on the affair at the beginning, Smiley should have received no
subsequent word of how it had developed. Control detested failure as he detested
illness, and his own failures most. He knew that to recognise failure was to live
with it; that a service that did not struggle did not survive. He detested the silk-
shirt agents, who hogged large chunks of the budget to the detriment of the
bread-and-butter networks in which he put his faith. He loved success, but he
detested miracles if they put the rest of his endeavour out of focus. He detested
weakness as he detested sentiment and religion, and he detested Percy Alleline,
who had a dash of most of them. His way of dealing with them was literally to
close the door: to withdraw into the dingy solitude of his upper rooms, receive
no visitors, and have all his phone calls fed to him by the mothers. The same
quiet ladies fed him jasmine tea and the countless office files that he sent for and
returned in heaps. Smiley would see them piled before the door as he went about
his own business of trying to keep the rest of the Circus afloat. Many were old,
from the days before Control led the pack. Some were personal, the biographies
of past and present members of the service.

Control never said what he was doing. If Smiley asked the mothers, or if Bill
Haydon sauntered in, favourite boy, and made the same enquiry, they only shook
their heads or silently raised their eyebrows towards paradise: “A terminal case,”
said these gentle glances. “We are humouring a great man at the end of his
career.” But Smiley—as he now patiently leafed through file after file, and in a
corner of his complex mind rehearsed Irina’s diary to Ricki Tarr—Smiley knew,
and in a quite real way took comfort from the knowledge, that he was not after
all the first to make this journey of exploration; that Control’s ghost was his
companion into all but the furthest reaches; and might even have stayed the
whole distance if Operation Testify, at the eleventh hour, had not stopped him
dead.

Breakfast again, and a much-subdued Welshman not drawn by undercooked
sausage and overcooked tomato.

“Do you want these back,” Lacon demanded, “or have you done with them?
They can’t be very enlightening, since they don’t even contain the reports.”

“Tonight, please, if you don’t mind.”

“I suppose you realise you look a wreck.”

He didn’t realise, but at Bywater Street, when he returned there, Ann’s pretty
gilt mirror showed his eyes red-rimmed and his plump cheeks clawed with
fatigue. He slept a little, then went his mysterious ways. When evening came,
Lacon was actually waiting for him. Smiley went straight on with his reading.

For six weeks, according to the files, the naval dispatch had no successor.
Other sections of the Ministry of Defence echoed the Admiralty’s enthusiasm for
the original dispatch; the Foreign Office remarked that “this document sheds an
extraordinary sidelight on Soviet aggressive thinking,” whatever that meant;
Alleline persisted in his demands for special handling of the material, but he was
like a general with no army. Lacon referred frostily to “the somewhat delayed
follow-up,” and suggested to his Minister that he should “defuse the situation
with the Admiralty.” From Control, according to the file, nothing. Perhaps he
was lying low and praying it would blow over. In the lull, a Treasury Moscow-
gazer sourly pointed out that Whitehall had seen plenty of this in recent years: an
encouraging first report, then silence or, worse, a scandal.

He was wrong. In the seventh week, Alleline announced publication of three
new Witchcraft reports all on the same day. All took the form of secret Soviet
interdepartmental correspondence, though the topics differed widely.

Witchcraft No. 2, according to Lacon’s summary, described tensions inside
Comecon and spoke of the degenerative effect of Western trade deals on its
weaker members. In Circus terms, this was a classic report from Roy Bland
territory, covering the very target that the Hungarian-based Aggravate network
had been attacking in vain for years. “Excellent tour d’horizon, ” wrote a Foreign
Office customer, “and backed by good collateral.”

Witchcraft No. 3 discussed revisionism in Hungary and Radar’s renewed
purges in political and academic life: the best way to end loose talk in Hungary,
said the author of the paper, borrowing a phrase coined by Khrushchev long
before, would be to shoot some more intellectuals. Once again this was Roy
Bland territory. “A salutary warning,” wrote the same Foreign Office
commentator, “to all those who like to think the Soviet Union is going soft on
satellites.”

These two reports were both in essence background, but Witchcraft No. 4 was
sixty pages long and held by the customers to be unique. It was an immensely
technical Soviet Foreign Service appreciation of the advantages and
disadvantages of negotiating with a weakened American President. The
conclusion, on balance, was that by throwing the President a bone for his own
electorate, the Soviet Union could buy useful concessions in forthcoming

discussions on multiple nuclear warheads. But it seriously questioned the
desirability of allowing the United States to feel too much the loser, since this
could tempt the Pentagon into a retributive or preemptive strike. The report was
from the very heart of Bill Haydon territory. But, as Haydon himself wrote in a
touching minute to Alleline (promptly copied, without Haydon’s knowledge, to
the Minister and entered on the Cabinet Office file), in twenty-five years of
attacking the Soviet nuclear target he had not laid his hands on anything of this
quality.

“Nor,” he concluded, “unless I am extremely mistaken, have our American
brothers-in-arms. I know that these are early days, but it does occur to me that
anyone taking this material to Washington could drive a very hard bargain in
return. Indeed, if Merlin maintains the standard, I would venture to predict that
we could buy anything there is to have in the American agency’s shop.”

Percy Alleline had his reading-room; and George Smiley made himself a
coffee on the derelict burner beside the washstand. Midway the meter ran out,
and in a temper he called for Norman and ordered five pounds’ worth of
shillings.

17

With mounting interest, Smiley continued his journey through Lacon’s meagre
records from that first meeting of protagonists until the present day. At the time,
such a mood of suspicion had gripped the Circus that even between Smiley and
Control the subject of Source Merlin became taboo. Alleline brought up the
Witchcraft reports and waited in the anteroom while the mothers took them to
Control, who signed them at once in order to demonstrate that he had not read
them. Alleline took back the file, poked his head round Smiley’s door, grunted a
greeting, and clumped down the staircase. Bland kept his distance, and even Bill
Haydon’s breezy visits—traditionally a part of the life up there, of the “talking
shop” that Control in the old days had liked to foster among his senior
lieutenants—became fewer and shorter, then ceased entirely.

“Control’s going potty,” Haydon told Smiley with contempt. “And if I’m not
mistaken he’s also dying. It’s just a question of which gets him first.”

The customary Tuesday meetings were discontinued, and Smiley found
himself constantly harassed by Control either to go abroad on some blurred
errand or to visit the domestic outstations—Sarratt, Brixton, Acton, and the rest
—as his personal envoy. He had a growing feeling that Control wanted him out
of the way. When they talked, he felt the heavy strain of suspicion between them,
so that even Smiley seriously wondered whether Bill was right and Control was
unfit for his job.

The Cabinet Office files made it clear that those next three months saw a
steady flowering of the Witchcraft operation, without any help from Control.
Reports came in at the rate of two or even three a month, and the standard,
according to the customers, continued excellent, but Control’s name was seldom
mentioned and he was never invited to comment. Occasionally the evaluators
produced quibbles. More often they complained that corroboration was not
possible, since Merlin took them into uncharted areas: could we not ask the
Americans to check? We could not, said the Minister. Not yet, said Alleline; who
in a confidential minute seen by no one, added, “When the time is ripe we shall
do more than barter our material for theirs. We are not interested in a one-time
deal. Our task is to establish Merlin’s track record beyond all doubt. When that is
done, Haydon can go to market...”

There was no longer any question of it. Among the chosen few who were
admitted to the chambers of the Adriatic Working Party, Merlin was already a
winner. His material was accurate; often other sources confirmed it

retrospectively. A Witchcraft committee formed, with the Minister in the chair.
Alleline was vice-chairman. Merlin had become an industry, and Control was not
even employed. Which was why in desperation he had sent out Smiley with his
beggar’s bowl: “There are three of them and Alleline,” he said. “Sweat them,
George. Tempt them, bully them, give them whatever they eat.”

Of those meetings also, the files were blessedly ignorant, for they belonged in
the worst rooms of Smiley’s memory. He had known already that there was
nothing left in Control’s larder that would satisfy their hunger.

It was April. Smiley had come back from Portugal, where he had been
burying a scandal, to find Control living under siege. Files lay strewn over the
floor; new locks had been fitted to the windows. He had put the tea-cosy over his
one telephone and from the ceiling hung a baffler against electronic
eavesdropping—a thing like an electric fan, which constantly varied its pitch. In
the three weeks Smiley had been away. Control had become an old man.

“Tell them they’re buying their way in with counterfeit money,” he ordered,
barely looking up from his files. “Tell them any damn thing. I need time.”

“There are three of them and Alleline,” Smiley now repeated to himself,
seated at the Major’s card table and studying Lacon’s list of those who had been
Witchcraft-cleared. Today there were sixty-eight licensed visitors to the Adriatic
Working Party’s reading-room. Each, like a member of the Communist Party,
was numbered according to the date of his admission. The list had been retyped
since Control’s death; Smiley was not included. But the same four founding
fathers still headed the list: Alleline, Bland, Esterhase, and Bill Haydon. Three of
them and Alleline, Control had said.

Suddenly Smiley’s mind, open as he read to every inference, every oblique
connection, was assailed by a quite extraneous vision: of himself and Ann
walking the Cornish cliffs. It was the time immediately after Control’s death, the
worst time Smiley could remember in their long, puzzled marriage. They were
high on the coast, somewhere between Eamorna and Porthcurno; they had gone
there out of season ostensibly for Ann to take the sea air for her cough. They had
been following the coast path, each lost in his thoughts: she to Haydon, he
supposed; he to Control, to Jim Prideaux and Testify, and the whole mess he had
left behind him on retirement. They shared no harmony. They had lost all
calmness in one another’s company; they were a mystery to each other, and the
most banal conversation could take strange, uncontrollable directions. In
Eondon, Ann had been living quite wildly, taking anyone who would have her.

He knew she was trying to bury something that hurt or worried her very much;
but he knew no way to reach her.

“If I had died,” she demanded suddenly, “rather than Control, say, how would

you feel towards Bill?”

Smiley was still pondering his answer when she threw in: “I sometimes think I
safeguard your opinion of him. Is that possible? That I somehow keep the two of
you together. Is that possible?”

“It’s possible.” He added, “Yes, I suppose I’m dependent on him, too, in a
way.”

“Is Bill still important in the Circus?”

“More than he was, probably.”

“And he still goes to Washington, wheels and deals with them, turns them
upside down?”

“I expect so. I hear so.”

“Is he as important as you were?”

“I suppose.”

“I suppose,” she repeated. “I expect. I hear. Is he better, then? A better
performer than you, better at the arithmetic? Tell me. Please tell me. You must.”

She was strangely excited. Her eyes, tearful from the wind, shone desperately
upon him; she had both hands on his arm and, like a child, was dragging on him
for an answer.

“You’ve always told me that men aren’t to be compared,” he replied
awkwardly. “You’ve always said you didn’t think in that category of
comparison.”

“Tell me!”

“All right: no, he’s not better.”

“As good?”

“ No.”

“And if I wasn’t there, what would you think of him then? If Bill were not my
cousin, not my anything? Tell me, would you think more of him, or less?”

“Less, I suppose.”

“Then think less now. I divorce him from the family, from our lives, from
everything. Here and now. I throw him into the sea. There. Do you understand?”

He understood only: go back to the Circus, finish your business. It was one of
a dozen ways she had of saying the same thing.

Still disturbed by this intrusion on his memory, Smiley stood up in rather a
flurry and went to the window, his habitual lookout when he was distracted. A
line of sea-gulls, a half dozen of them, had settled on the parapet. He must have
heard them calling, and remembered that walk to Lamorna.

“I cough when there are things I can’t say,” Ann had told him once. What
couldn’t she say then, he asked glumly of the chimney-pots across the street.
Connie could say it, Martindale could say it; so why couldn’t Ann?

“Three of them and Alleline,” Smiley muttered aloud. The sea-gulls had gone,
all at once, as if they had spotted a better place. “Tell them they’re buying their
way in with counterfeit money.” And if the banks accept the money? If the
experts pronounce it genuine, and Bill Haydon praises it to the skies? And the
Cabinet Office files are full of plaudits for the brave new men of Cambridge
Circus, who have finally broken the jinx?

He had chosen Esterhase first because Toby owed Smiley his career. Smiley
had recruited him in Vienna, a starving student living in the ruins of a museum
of which his dead uncle had been curator. He drove down to Acton and bearded
him at the Laundry across his walnut desk with its row of ivory telephones. On
the wall, kneeling Magi, questionable Italian seventeenth century. Through the
window, a closed courtyard crammed with cars and vans and motorbikes, and
rest-huts where the teams of lamplighters killed time between shifts. First Smiley
asked Toby about his family: there was a son who went to Westminster and a
daughter at medical school, first year. Then he put it to Toby that the
lamplighters were two months behind on their worksheets, and when Toby
hedged he asked him outright whether his boys had been doing any special jobs
recently, either at home or abroad, which for good reasons of security Toby
didn’t feel able to mention in his returns.

“Who would I do that for, George?” Toby had asked, dead-eyed. “You know
in my book that’s completely illegal.” And idiom, in Toby’s book, had a way of
being ludicrous.

“Well, I can see you doing it for Percy Alleline, for one,” Smiley suggested,
feeding him the excuse: “After all, if Percy ordered you to do something and not
to record it, you’d be in a very difficult position.”

“What sort of something, though, George, I wonder?”

“Clear a foreign letter-box, prime a safe house, watch someone’s back, spike
an embassy. Percy’s Director of Operations, after all. You might think he was
acting on instructions from the fifth floor. I can see that happening quite
reasonably.”

Toby looked carefully at Smiley. He was holding a cigarette, but apart from
lighting it he hadn’t smoked it at all. It was a hand-rolled affair, taken from a
silver box, but once lit, it never went into his mouth. It swung around, along the
line or away to the side; sometimes it was poised to take the plunge, but it never
did. Meanwhile Toby made his speech: one of Toby’s personal statements,
supposedly definitive about where he stood at this point in his life.

Toby liked the service, he said. He would prefer to remain in it. He felt
sentimental about it. He had other interests and at any time they could claim him
altogether, but he liked the service best. His trouble was, he said, promotion. Not

that he wanted it for any greedy reason. He would say his reasons were social.

“You know, George, I have so many years’ seniority I feel actually quite
embarrassed when these young fellows ask me to take orders from them. You
know what I mean? Acton, even—^just the name of Acton for them is
ridiculous.”

“Oh,” said Smiley mildly. “Which young fellows are these?”

But Esterhase had lost interest. His statement completed, his face settled again
into its familiar blank expression, his doll’s eyes fixed on a point in the middle
distance.

“Do you mean Roy Bland?” Smiley asked. “Or Percy? Is Percy young? Who,
Toby?”

It was no good, Toby regretted: “George, when you are overdue for promotion
and working your fingers to the bones, anyone looks young who’s above you on
the ladder.”

“Perhaps Gontrol could move you up a few rungs,” Smiley suggested, not
much caring for himself in this role.

Esterhase’s reply struck a chill. “Well, actually, you know, George, I am not
too sure he is able these days. Look here”—opening a drawer—“I give Ann
something. When I heard you were coming, I phone a couple of friends of mine;
something beautiful, I say, something for a faultless woman; you know I never
forget her since we met once at Bill Haydon’s cocktail?”

So Smiley carried off the consolation prize—a costly scent, smuggled, he
assumed, by one of Toby’s homing lamplighters—and took his beggar bowl to
Bland, knowing as he did so that he was coming one step nearer to Haydon.

Returning to the Major’s table, Smiley searched through Lacon’s files till he
came to a slim volume marked “Operation Witchcraft, direct subsidies,” which
recorded the earliest expenses incurred through the running of Source Merlin.
“For reasons of security it is proposed,” wrote Alleline in yet another personal
memo to the Minister, this one dated almost two years ago, “to keep the
Witchcraft financing absolutely separate from all other Gircus imprests. Until
some proper cover can be found, I am asking you for direct subventions from
Treasury funds rather than mere supplementaries to the Secret Vote, which in due
course are certain to find their way into the mainstream of Circus accounting. I
shall then account to you personally.”

“Approved,” wrote the Minister a week later, “provided always ...”

There were no provisions. A glance at the first row of figures showed Smiley
all he needed to know: already by May of that year, when that interview at Acton

took place, Toby Esterhase had personally made no fewer than eight trips on the
Witchcraft budget, two to Paris, two to The Hague, one to Helsinki, and three to
Berlin. In each case the purpose of the journey was curtly described as
“Collecting product.” Between May and November, when Control faded from
the scene, he made a further nineteen. One of these took him to Sofia, another to
Istanbul. None required him to be absent for more than three full days. Most
took place at weekends. On several such journeys, he was accompanied by
Bland.

Not to put too fine an edge on it, Toby Esterhase, as Smiley had never
seriously doubted, had lied in his teeth. It was nice to find the record confirming
his impression.

Smiley’s feelings towards Roy Bland had at that time been ambivalent.
Recalling them now, he decided they still were. A don had spotted him, Smiley
had recruited him; the combination was oddly akin to the one that had brought
Smiley himself into the Circus net. But this time there was no German monster
to fan the patriotic flame, and Smiley had always been a little embarrassed by
protestations of anti-Communism. Like Smiley, Bland had no real childhood. His
father was a docker, a passionate trade-unionist, and a Party member. His mother
died when Bland was a boy. His father hated education as he hated authority, and
when Bland grew clever the father took it into his head that he had lost his son to
the ruling class and beat the life out of him. Bland fought his way to grammar
school and in the holidays worked his fingers, as Toby would say, to the bones,
in order to raise the extra fee. When Smiley met him in his tutor’s rooms at
Oxford, he had the battered look of someone just arrived from a bad journey.

Smiley took him up, and over several months edged closer to a proposition,
which Bland accepted—largely, Smiley assumed, out of animosity towards his
father. After that he passed out of Smiley’s care. Subsisting on odd grants
undescribed. Bland toiled in the Marx Memorial Library and wrote leftish papers
for tiny magazines that would have died long ago had the Circus not subsidized
them. In the evenings he disputed loud and long at smoky meetings in pubs and
school halls. In the vacations he went to the Nursery, where a fanatic called
Thatch ran a charm school for outward-bound penetration agents, one pupil at a
time. Thatch trained Bland in tradecraft and carefully nudged his progressive
opinions nearer to his father’s Marxist camp. Three years to the day after his
recruitment, partly thanks to his proletarian pedigree, and his father’s influence
at King Street, Bland won a year’s appointment as assistant lector in economics
at the University of Poznan. He was launched.

From Poland he applied successfully for a post at the Budapest Academy of
Sciences, and for the next eight years he lived the nomadic life of a minor left-

wing intellectual in search of light, often liked but never trusted. He staged in
Prague, returned to Poland, did a hellish two semesters in Sofia and six in Kiev,
where he had a nervous breakdown, his second in as many months. Once more
the Nursery took charge of him, this time to dry him out. He was passed as clean,
his networks were given to other fieldmen, and Roy himself was brought into the
Circus to manage, mainly from a desk, the networks he had recruited in the field.
Recently, it had seemed to Smiley, Bland had become very much Haydon’s
colleague. If Smiley chanced to call on Roy for a chat, like as not Bill was
lounging in his armchair surrounded by papers, charts, and cigarette smoke; if he
dropped in on Bill, it was no surprise to find Bland, in a sweat-soaked shirt,
padding heavily back and forth across the carpet. Bill had Russia, Bland the
satellites; but already in those early days of Witchcraft, the distinction had all but
vanished.

They met at a pub in St. John’s Wood—still May—half past five on a dull day
and the garden empty. Roy brought a child, a boy of five or so, a tiny Bland, fair,
burly, and pink-faced. He didn’t explain the boy, but sometimes as they talked he
shut off and watched him where he sat on a bench away from them, eating nuts.
Nervous breakdowns or not. Bland still bore the imprimatur of the Thatch
philosophy for agents in the enemy camp: self-faith, positive participation. Pied
Piper appeal, and all those other uncomfortable phrases which in the high day of
the cold-war culture had turned the Nursery into something close to a moral-
rearmament centre.

“So what’s the deal?” Bland asked affably.

“There isn’t one really, Roy. Control feels that the present situation is
unhealthy. He doesn’t like to see you getting mixed up in a cabal. Nor do I.”

“Great. So what’s the deal?”

“What do you want?”

On the table, soaked from the earlier rain fall, was a cruet set left over from
lunchtime, with a bunch of paper-wrapped cellulose toothpicks in the centre
compartment. Taking one. Bland spat the paper onto the grass and began
working his back teeth with the fat end.

“Well, how about a five-thousand-quid backhander out the reptile fund?”

“And a house and a car?” said Smiley, making a joke of it.

“And the kid to Eton,” Bland added, and winked across the concrete paving to
the boy while he went on working with the toothpick. “I’ve paid, see, George.
You know that. I don’t know what I’ve bought with it but I’ve paid a hell of a
lot. I want some back. Ten years’ solitary for the fifth floor; that’s big money at
any age. Even yours. There must have been a reason why I fell for all that spiel,
but I can’t quite remember what it was. Must be your magnetic personality.”

Smiley’s glass was still going, so Bland fetched himself another from the bar,
and something for the boy as well.

“You’re an educated sort of swine,” he announced easily as he sat down again.
“An artist is a bloke who can hold two fundamentally opposing views and still
function: who dreamed that one up?”

“Scott Fitzgerald,” Smiley replied, thinking for a moment that Bland was
proposing to say something about Bill Haydon.

“Well, Fitzgerald knew a thing or two,” Bland affirmed. As he drank, his
bulging eyes slid sideways toward the fence, as if in search of someone. “And
I’m definitely functioning, George. As a good Socialist, I’m going for the
money. As a good capitalist. I’m sticking with the revolution, because if you
can’t beat it spy on it. Don’t look like that, George. It’s the name of the game
these days: you scratch my conscience. I’ll drive your Jag, right?” He was
already lifting an arm as he said this. “With you in a minute!” he called across
the lawn. “Set one up for me!”

Two girls were hovering on the other side of the wire fence.

“Is that Bill’s joke?” Smiley asked, suddenly quite angry.

“Is what?”

“Is that one of Bill’s jokes about materialist England, the pigs-in-clover
society?”

“Gould be,” said Bland, and finished his drink. “Don’t you like it?”

“Not too much, no. I never knew Bill before as a radical reformer. What’s
come over him all of a sudden?”

“That’s not radical,” Bland retorted, resenting any devaluation of his
Socialism, or of Haydon. “That’s just looking out the bloody window. That’s just
England now, man. Nobody wants that, do they?”

“So how do you propose,” Smiley demanded, hearing himself at his pompous
worst, “to destroy the acquisitive and competitive instincts in Western society
without also destroying...”

Bland had finished his drink; and the meeting, too. “Why should you be
bothered? You’ve got Bill’s job. What more do you want? Long as it lasts.”

And Bill’s got my wife, Smiley thought as Bland rose to go; and, damn him,
he’s told you.

The boy had invented a game. He had laid a table on its side and was rolling
an empty bottle onto the gravel. Each time, he started the bottle higher up the
table-top. Smiley left before it smashed.

Unlike Esterhase, Bland had not even bothered to lie. Lacon’s files made no
pretence of his involvement with the Witchcraft operation:

“Source Merlin,” wrote Alleline, in a minute dated soon after Control’s
departure, “is in every sense a committee operation ... I cannot honestly say
which of my three assistants deserves most praise. The energy of Bland has been
an inspiration to us all...” He was replying to the Minister’s suggestion that
those responsible for Witchcraft should be honoured in the New Year’s list.
“While Haydon’s operational ingenuity is at times little short of Merlin’s own,”
he added. The medals went to all three; Alleline’s appointment as Chief was
confirmed, and with it his beloved knighthood.

18

Which left me Bill, thought Smiley. In the course of most London nights, there
is one respite from alarm. Ten, twenty minutes, thirty, even an hour, and not a
drunk groans or a child cries or a car’s tyres whine into a collision. In Sussex
Gardens it happens around three. That night it came early, at one, as Smiley
stood once more at his dormer window peering down like a prisoner at Mrs.

Pope Graham’s sand patch, where a Bedford van had recently parked. Its roof
was daubed with slogans: “Sydney 90 Days,” “Athens Non-Stop,” “Mary Lou
Here We Gome.” A light glowed inside, and he presumed some children were
sleeping there in unmarried bliss. “Kids,” he was supposed to call them. Gurtains
covered the windows.

Which left me Bill, he thought, still staring at the closed curtains of the van
and its flamboyant globe-trotting proclamations; which left me Bill, and our
friendly little chat in Bywater Street—^just the two of us, old friends, old
comrades-at-arms, “sharing everything,” as Martindale had it so elegantly, but
Ann sent out for the evening so that the men could be alone. “Which left me
Bill,” he repeated hopelessly, and felt the blood rise, and the colours of his vision
heighten, and his sense of moderation begin its dangerous slide.

Who was he? Smiley had no focus on him any more. Each time he thought of
him, he drew him too large, and different. Until Ann’s affair with him, he
thought he knew Bill pretty well, his brilliance and its limitations. He was of that
pre-war set that seemed to have vanished for good, which managed to be
disreputable and high-minded at the same time. His father was a high court
judge, two of his several beautiful sisters had married into the aristocracy; at
Oxford he favoured the unfashionable right rather than the fashionable left, but
never to the point of strain. From his late teens he had been a keen explorer and
amateur painter of brave, if over-ambitious, stamp; several of his paintings now
hung in Miles Sercombe’s fatuous palace in Garlton Gardens. He had
connections in every embassy and consulate across the Middle East and he used
them ruthlessly. He took up remote languages with ease, and when 1939 came,
the Gircus snapped him up; they had had their eye on him for years. He had a
dazzling war. He was ubiquitous and charming; he was unorthodox and
occasionally outrageous. He was probably heroic. The comparison with
Lawrence was inevitable.

And it was true, Smiley conceded, that Bill in his time had fiddled with
substantial pieces of history; had proposed all sorts of grand designs for restoring

England to influence and greatness—like Rupert Brooke, he seldom spoke of
Britain. But Smiley, in his rare moments of objectivity, could remember few that
ever got off the ground.

It was the other side of Haydon’s nature, by contrast, that as a colleague he
had found easier to respect: the slow-burning skills of the natural agent runner;
his rare sense of balance in the playing back of double agents and the mounting
of deception operations; his art of fostering affection, even love, though it ran
against the grain of other loyalties.

As witness, thank you, my wife.

Perhaps Bill really is out of scale, Smiley thought hopelessly, still grappling
for a sense of proportion. Picturing him now, and putting him beside Bland,
Esterhase, even Alleline, it did truthfully seem to Smiley that all of them were,
to a great or small extent, imperfect imitations of that one original, Haydon. That
their affectations were like steps towards the same unobtainable ideal of the
rounded man, even if the ideal was itself misconceived, or misplaced; even if
Bill was utterly unworthy of it. Bland in his blunt impertinence, Esterhase in his
lofty artificial Englishness, Alleline with his shallow gift of leadership—without
Bill they were a disarray. Smiley also knew, or thought he knew—the idea came
to him now as a mild enlightenment—that Bill in turn was also very little by
himself: that while his admirers (Bland, Prideaux, Alleline, Esterhase, and all the
rest of the supporters’ club) might find in him completeness. Bill’s real trick was
to use them, to live through them to complete himself, here a piece, there a
piece, from their passive identities, thus disguising the fact that he was less, far
less, than the sum of his apparent qualities ... and finally submerging this
dependence beneath an artist’s arrogance, calling them the creatures of his mind .

“That’s quite enough,” said Smiley aloud.

Withdrawing abruptly from this insight, dismissing it irritably as yet another
theory about Bill, he cooled his overheated mind with the recollection of their
last meeting.

“I suppose you want to grill me about bloody Merlin,” Bill began. He looked
tired and nervy; it was his time for commuting to Washington. In the old days he
would have brought an unsuitable girl and sent her to sit with Ann upstairs while
they talked their business; expecting Ann to bolster his genius to her, thought
Smiley cruelly. They were all of the same sort: half his age, bedraggled art
school, clinging, surly; Ann used to say he had a supplier. And once, to shock, he
brought a ghastly youth called Steggie, an assistant barman from one of the
Chelsea pubs, with an open shirt and a gold chain round his midriff.

“Well, they do say you write the reports,” Smiley explained.

“1 thought that was Bland’s job,” said Bill with his foxy grin.

“Roy makes the translations,” said Smiley. “You draft the covering reports;
they’re typed on your machine. The material’s not cleared for typists at all.”

Bill listened carefully, brows lifted, as if at any moment he might interrupt
with an objection or a more congenial topic, then hoisted himself from the deep
armchair and ambled to the bookcase, where he stood a full shelf higher than
Smiley. Fishing out a volume with his long fingers, he peered into it, grinning.

“Percy Alleline won’t do,” he announced, turning a page, “is that the
premise?”

“Pretty well.”

“Which means that Merlin won’t do, either. Merlin would do if he were my
source, wouldn’t he? What would happen if Bloody Bill here pottered along to
Control and said he’d hooked a big fish and wanted to play him alone? That’s
very nifty of you. Bill, boy,’ Control would say. 'You do it just the way you
want. Bill, boy—’course you do. Have some filthy tea.’ He’d be giving me a
medal by now, instead of sending you snooping round the corridors. We used to
be rather a classy bunch. Why are we so vulgar these days?”

“He thinks Percy’s on the make,” Smiley said.

“So he is. So am 1.1 want to be head boy. Did you know that? Time 1 made
something of myself, George. Half a painter, half a spy—time 1 was all
something. Since when was ambition a sin in our beastly outfit?”

“Who runs him. Bill?”

“Percy? Karla does—who else? Lower-class bloke with upper-class sources,
must be a bounder. Percy’s sold out to Karla; it’s the only explanation.” He had
developed the art, long ago, of deliberately misunderstanding. “Percy’s our
house mole,” he said.

“1 meant who runs Merlin? Who is Merlin? What’s going on?”

Leaving the bookcase, Haydon took himself on a tour of Smiley’s drawings.
“This is a Callot, isn’t it,” unhooking a small gilt frame and holding it to the
light, “it’s nice.” He tilted his spectacles to make them magnify. Smiley was
certain he had looked at it a dozen times before, “it’s very nice. Doesn’t anyone
think my nose should be out of joint? 1 am supposed to be in charge of the
Russian target, you know. Given it my best years, set up networks, talent-
spotters, all mod cons. You chaps on the fifth floor have forgotten what it’s like
to run an operation where it takes you three days to post a letter and you don’t
even get an answer for your trouble.”

Smiley, dutifully: Yes, 1 have forgotten. Yes, 1 sympathise. No, Ann is

nowhere in my thoughts. We are colleagues, after all, and men of the world; we
are here to talk about Merlin and Control.

“Along comes this upstart Percy, damn Caledonian street-merchant, no
shadow of class, shoving a whole wagonload of Russian goodies. Bloody
annoying, don’t you think?”

“Very.”

“Trouble is, my networks aren’t very good. Much easier to spy on Percy than
—” He broke off, tired of his own thesis. His attention had settled on a tiny van
Mieris head in chalk. “And I fancy this very much,” he said.

“Ann gave it me.”

“Amends?”

“Probably.”

“Must have been quite a sin. How long have you had it?”

Even now, Smiley remembered noticing how silent it was in the street.
Tuesday? Wednesday? And he remembered thinking: No, Bill. For you I have so
far received no consolation prize at all. As of this evening, you don’t even rate a
pair of bedroom slippers . . . Thinking but not saying.

“Is Control dead yet?” Haydon asked.

“Just busy.”

“What does he do all day? He’s like a hermit with the clap, scratching around
all on his own in that cave up there. All those bloody files he reads—what’s he
about, for God’s sake? Sentimental tour of his unlovely past. I’ll bet. He looks
sick as a cat. I suppose that’s Merlin’s fault, too, is it?”

Again Smiley said nothing.

“Why doesn’t he eat with the cooks? Why doesn’t he join us instead of
grubbing around for truffles up there? What’s he after?”

“I didn’t know he was after anything,” said Smiley.

“Ah, stop flirting around. Of course he is. I’ve got a source up there—one of
the mothers, didn’t you know? Tells me indiscretions for chocolate. Control’s
been toiling through personal dossiers of old Circus folk heroes, sniffing out the
dirt, who was pink, who was a queen. Half of them are under the earth already.
Making a study of all our failures. Can you imagine? And for why? Because
we’ve got a success on our hands. He’s mad, George. He’s got the big itch:
senile paranoia, take my word for it. Ann ever tell you about wicked Uncle Fry?
Thought the servants were bugging the roses to find out where he’d hidden his
money. Get away from him, George. Death’s a bore. Cut the cord, move down a
few floors. Join the proles.”

Ann had still not returned, so they sauntered side by side down the King’s
Road looking for a cab while Bill enunciated his latest vision of politics, and

Smiley said “Yes, Bill,” “No, Bill,” and wondered how he was going to break it
to Control. He forgot now which particular vision it was. The year before. Bill
had been a great hawk. He had wanted to run down conventional forces in
Europe and replace them outright with nuclear weapons. He was about the only
person left in Whitehall who believed in Britain’s independent deterrent. This
year, if Smiley remembered rightly. Bill was an aggressive English pacifist and
wanted the Sweden solution but without the Swedes.

No cab came; it was a beautiful night, and like old friends they went on
walking, side by side.

“By the by, if you ever want to sell that Mieris, let me know, will you? I’ll
give you a bloody decent price for it.”

Thinking Bill was making another bad joke, Smiley rounded on him, at last
prepared to be angry. Haydon was not even conscious of his interest. He was
gazing down the street, his long arm raised at an approaching cab.

“Oh, Christ, look at them,” he shouted irritably. “Full of bloody Jews going to
Quag’s.”

“Bill’s backside must look like a damn gridiron,” Control muttered next day,
barely looking up from his reading. “The years he’s spent sitting on the fence.”

For a moment he stared at Smiley in an unfocused way, as if looking through
him to some different, less fleshy prospect; then ducked his eyes and seemed to
resume his reading. “I’m glad he’s not my cousin,” he said.

The following Monday, the mothers had surprising news for Smiley. Control
had flown to Belfast for discussions with the army. Later, checking the travel
imprests, Smiley nailed the lie. No one in the Circus had flown to Belfast that
month, but there was a charge for a first-class return to Vienna and the issuing
authority was given as G. Smiley.

Haydon, also looking for Control, was cross: “So now what’s the pitch?
Dragging Ireland into the net, creating an organisational diversion, I suppose.
Jesus, your man’s a bore!”

The light in the van went out, but Smiley continued to gaze at its garish roof.
How do they live? he wondered. What do they do for water, money? He tried to
fathom the logistics of a troglodyte life in Sussex Gardens: water, drains, light.
Ann would work them out all right; so would Bill.

Facts. What were the facts?

Facts were that one balmy pre-Witchcraft summer evening, I returned
unexpectedly from Berlin to find Bill Haydon stretched on the drawing-room
floor and Ann playing Liszt on the gramophone. Ann was sitting across the room
from him in her dressing gown, wearing no make-up. There was no scene;

everyone behaved with painful naturalness. According to Bill, he had dropped
by on his way from the airport, having just flown in from Washington; Ann had
been in bed but insisted on getting up to receive him. We agreed it was a pity we
hadn’t shared a car from Heathrow. Bill left; I asked “What did he want?” And
Ann said: “A shoulder to cry on.” Bill was having girl trouble, wanted to pour
out his heart, she said.

“There’s Felicity in Washington, who wants a baby, and Jan in London, who’s
having one.”

“Bill’s?”

“God knows. I’m sure Bill doesn’t.”

Next morning, without even wishing to, Smiley established that Bill had been
back in London two days, not one. Following the episode. Bill showed an
uncharacteristic deference towards Smiley, and Smiley reciprocated with acts of
courtesy which normally belong to a newer friendship. In due course Smiley
noticed that the secret was out, and he was still mystified by the speed with
which that had happened. He supposed Bill had boasted to someone, perhaps
Bland. If the word was correct, Ann had broken three of her own rules. Bill was
Circus and he was Set—her word for family and ramifications. On either count
he would be out of bounds. Thirdly, she had received him at Bywater Street, an
agreed violation of territorial decencies.

Withdrawing once more into his own lonely life, Smiley waited for Ann to say
something. He moved into the spare room and arranged for himself plenty of
evening engagements in order that he would not be too aware of her comings
and goings. Gradually it dawned on him that she was deeply unhappy. She lost
weight, she lost her sense of play, and if he didn’t know her better he would have
sworn she was having a bad bout of the guilts, even of self-disgust. When he was
gentle with her, she fended him off; she showed no interest in Christmas
shopping and developed a wasting cough, which he knew was her signal of
distress. If it had not been for Operation Testify, they would have left for
Cornwall earlier. As it was, they had to postpone the trip till January, by which
time Control was dead, Smiley was unemployed, the scale had tipped; and Ann,
to his mortification, was covering the Haydon card with as many others as she
could pull from the pack.

So what happened? Did she break off the affair? Did Haydon? Why did she
never speak of it? Did it matter, anyway—one among so many? He gave up.

Like the Cheshire cat, the face of Bill Haydon seemed to recede as soon as he
advanced upon it, leaving only the smile behind. But he knew that somehow Bill
had hurt her deeply, which was the sin of sins.

19

Returning with a grunt of distaste to the unlovable table, Smiley resumed his
reading of Merlin’s progress since his own enforced retirement from the Circus.
The new regime of Percy Alleline, he at once noticed, had immediately produced
several favourable changes in Merlin’s life-style. It was like a maturing, a
settling down. The night dashes to European capitals ceased; the flow of
intelligence became more regular and less nervy. There were headaches,
certainly. Merlin’s demands for money—requirements, never threats—
continued, and with the steady decline in the value of the pound these large
payments in foreign currency caused the Treasury much agony. There was even
a suggestion at one point, never pursued, that “since we are the country of
Merlin’s choice, he should be ready to shoulder his portion of our financial
vicissitudes.” Haydon and Bland exploded, apparently: “I have not the face,”
wrote Alleline with rare frankness to the Minister, “to mention this subject to my
staff again.”

There was also a row about a new camera, which at great expense was broken
into tubular components by nuts and bolts section and fitted into a standard lamp
of Soviet manufacture. The lamp, after screams of pain—this time from the
Foreign Office—was spirited to Moscow by diplomatic bag. The problem was
then the drop. The residency could not be informed of Merlin’s identity, nor did
it know the contents of the lamp. The lamp was unwieldy, and would not fit the
boot of the resident’s car. After several shots, an untidy handover was achieved,
but the camera never worked and there was bad blood between the Circus and its
Moscow residency as a result. A less ambitious model was taken by Esterhase to
Helsinki, where it was handed—thus Alleline’s memo to the Minister—to “a
trusted intermediary whose frontier crossings would go unchallenged.”

Suddenly, Smiley sat up with a jolt.

“We spoke,” wrote Alleline to the Minister, in a minute dated February 27th
this year. “You agreed to submit a supplementary estimate to the Treasury for a
Eondon house to be carried on the Witchcraft budget.”

He read it once, then again more slowly. The Treasury had sanctioned sixty
thousand pounds for the freehold and another ten for furniture and fittings. To
cut costs, it wanted its own lawyers to handle the conveyance. Alleline refused
to reveal the address. For the same reason there was an argument about who
should keep the deeds. This time the Treasury put its foot down and its lawyers
drew up instruments to get the house back from Alleline should he die or go

bankrupt. But he still kept the address to himself, as also the justification for this
remarkable, and costly, adjunct to an operation that was supposedly taking place
abroad.

Smiley searched eagerly for an explanation. The financial files, he quickly
confirmed, were scrupulous to offer none. They contained only one veiled
reference to the London house, and that was when the rates were doubled:
Minister to Alleline: “I assume the London end is still necessary?” Adeline to
Minister: “Eminently. I would say more than ever. I would add that the circle of
knowledge has not widened since our conversation.” What knowledge?

It was not till he went back to the files which appraised the Witchcraft product
that he came on the solution. The house was paid for in late March. Occupancy
followed immediately. From the same date exactly. Merlin began to acquire a
personality, and it was shaped here in the customers’ comments. Till now, to
Smiley’s suspicious eye. Merlin had been a machine: faultless in tradecraft, eerie
in access, free of the strains that make most agents such hard going. Now,
suddenly, he was having a tantrum.

“We put to Merlin your follow-up question about the prevailing Kremlin view
on the sale of Russian oil surpluses to the United States. We suggested to him, at
your request, that this was at odds with his report last month that the Kremlin is
presently flirting with the Tanaka government for a contract to sell Siberian oil
on the Japanese market. Merlin saw no contradiction in the two reports and
declined to forecast which market might ultimately be favoured.”

Whitehall regretted its temerity.

“Merlin will not, repeat not, add to his report on the repression of Georgian
nationalism and the rioting in Tbilisi. Not being himself a Georgian, he takes the
traditional Russian view that all Georgians are thieves and vagabonds, and better
behind bars ...”

Whitehall agreed not to press.

Merlin had suddenly drawn nearer. Was it only the acquisition of a London
house that gave Smiley this new sense of Merlin’s physical proximity? From the
remote stillness of a Moscow winter. Merlin seemed suddenly to be sitting here
before him in the tattered room; in the street outside his window, waiting in the
rain, where now and then, he knew, Mendel kept his solitary guard. Here out of
the blue was a Merlin who talked and answered back and gratuitously offered his
opinions, a Merlin who had time to be met. Met here in Fondon? Fed,
entertained, debriefed in a sixty-thousand-pound house while he threw his
weight about and made jokes about Georgians? What was this circle of
knowledge that had now formed itself even within the wider circle of those
initiated into the secrets of the Witchcraft operation?

At this point, an improbable figure flitted across the stage: one J.P.R., a new
recruit to Whitehall’s growing band of Witchcraft evaluators. Consulting the
indoctrination list, Smiley established that his full name was Ribble, and that he
was a member of Foreign Office Research Department. J. R Ribble was puzzled.

J.RR. to the Adriatic Working Party (A.W.P.): “May I respectfully draw your
attention to an apparent discrepancy concerning dates? Witchcraft No. 104
(Soviet-French discussions on joint aircraft production) is dated April 21st.
According to your covering minute. Merlin had this information directly from
General Markov on the day after the negotiating parties agreed to a secret
exchange of notes. But on that day, April 21st, according to our Paris Embassy,
Markov was still in Paris, and Merlin, as witness your Report No. 109, was
himself visiting a missile research establishment outside Leningrad . . .”

The minute cited no fewer than four similar “discrepancies,” which, put
together, suggested a degree of mobility in Merlin that would have done credit to
his miraculous namesake.

J. P. Ribble was told in as many words to mind his own business. But in a
separate minute to the Minister, Alleline made an extraordinary admission that
shed an entirely new light on the nature of the Witchcraft operation.

“Extremely secret and personal. We spoke. Merlin, as you have known for
some time, is not one source but several. While we have done our best for
security reasons to disguise this fact from your readers, the sheer volume of
material makes it increasingly difficult to continue with this fiction. Might it not
be time to come clean, at least on a limited basis? By the same token it would do
the Treasury no harm to learn that Merlin’s ten thousand Swiss francs a month in
salary, and a similar figure for expenses and running costs, are scarcely
excessive when the cloth has to be cut so many ways.”

But the minute ended on a harsher note: “Nevertheless, even if we agree to
open the door this far, I regard it as paramount that knowledge of the existence
of the London house, and the purpose for which it is used, remain absolutely at a
minimum. Indeed, once Merlin’s plurality is published among our readers, the
delicacy of the London operation is increased.”

Totally mystified, Smiley read this correspondence several times. Then, as if
struck by a sudden thought, he looked up, his face a picture of confusion. So far
away were his thoughts, indeed, so intense and complex, that the telephone rang
several times inside the room before he responded to the summons. Lifting the
receiver, he glanced at his watch; it was six in the evening; he had been reading
barely an hour.

“Mr. Barraclough? This is Lofthouse from finance, sir.”

Peter Guillam, using the emergency procedure, was asking by means of the

agreed phrases for a crash meeting, and he sounded shaken.

20

The Circus Archives were not accessible from the main entrance. They rambled
through a warren of dingy rooms and half-landings at the back of the building,
more like one of the second-hand bookshops that proliferate round there than the
organised memory of a large department. They were reached by a dull doorway
in the Charing Cross Road, jammed between a picture-framer and an all-day cafe
that was out of bounds to staff. A plate on the door read, “Town and Country
Language School, Staff Only,” and another, “C & L Distribution, Ltd.” To enter,
you pressed one or other bell and waited for Alwyn, an effeminate Marine who
spoke only of weekends. Till Wednesday or so, he spoke of the weekend past;
after that he spoke of the weekend to come. This morning, a Tuesday, he was in
a mood of indignant unrest.

“Here, what about that storm, then?” he demanded as he pushed the book
across the counter for Guillam to sign. “Might as well live in a lighthouse. All
Saturday, all Sunday. I said to my friend: 'Here we are in the middle of London
and listen to it.’ Want me to look after that for you?”

“You should have been where I was,” said Guillam, consigning the brown
canvas grip into Alwyn’s waiting hands. “Talk about listen to it, you could
hardly stand upright.”

Don’t be over-friendly, he thought, talking to himself.

“Still, I do like the country,” Alwyn confided, stowing the grip in one of the
open lockers behind the counter. “Want a number, then? I’m supposed to give
you one—the Dolphin would kill me if she knew.”

“I’ll trust you,” said Guillam. Climbing the four steps, he pushed open the
swing doors to the reading-room. The place was like a makeshift lecture hall: a
dozen desks all facing the same way, a raised area where the archivist sat.
Guillam took a desk near the back. It was still early—ten-ten by his watch—and
the only other reader was Ben Thruxton, of research, who spent most of his time
here. Long ago, masquerading as a Latvian dissident, Ben had run with
revolutionaries through the streets of Moscow calling death to the oppressors.
Now he crouched over his papers like an old priest, white-haired and perfectly
still.

Seeing Guillam standing at her desk, the archivist smiled. Quite often, when
Brixton was dead, Guillam would spend a day here searching through old cases
for one that could stand refiring. She was Sal, a plump, sporting girl who ran a
youth club in Chiswick and was a judo black-belt.

“Break any good necks this weekend?” he asked, helping himself to a bunch
of green requisition slips.

Sal handed him the notes she kept for him in her steel cupboard.

“Couple. How about you?”

“Visiting aunts in Shropshire, thank you.”

“Some aunts,” said Sal.

Still at her desk, he filled in slips for the next two references on his list. He
watched her stamp them, tear off the flimsies, and post them through a slot on
her desk.

“D corridor,” she murmured, handing back the top copies. “The two-eights are
halfway on your right, the three-ones are next alcove down.”

Pushing open the far door, he entered the main hall. At the centre an old lift
like a miner’s cage carried files into the body of the Circus. Two bleary juniors
were feeding it; a third stood by to operate the winch. Guillam moved slowly
along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards.

“Lacon swears he holds no file on Testify at all,” Smiley had explained in his
usual worried way. “He has a few resettlement papers on Prideaux and nothing
else.” And, in the same lugubrious tone: “So I’m afraid we’ll have to find a way
of getting hold of whatever there is in Circus Registry.”

For “getting hold,” in Smiley’s dictionary, read “steal.”

One girl stood on a ladder. Oscar Allitson, the collator, was f i l lin g a laundry
basket with wrangler files; Astrid, the maintenance man, was mending a radiator.
The shelves were wooden, deep as bunks, and divided into pigeon-holes by
panels of ply. He knew already that the Testify reference was 4482E which
meant alcove 44, where he now stood. “E” stood for “extinct” and was used for
dead operations only. Guillam counted to the eighth pigeon-hole from the left.
Testify should be second from the left, but there was no way of making certain
because the spines were unmarked. His reconnaissance complete, he drew the
two files he had requested, leaving the green slips in the steel brackets provided
for them.

“There won’t be much. I’m sure,” Smiley had said, as if thinner files were
easier. “But there ought to be something, if only for appearances.” That was
another thing about him that Guillam didn’t like just then: he spoke as if you
followed his reasoning, as if you were inside his mind all the time.

Sitting down, he pretended to read but passed the time thinking of Camilla.
What was he supposed to make of her? Early this morning as she lay in his arms,
she told him she had once been married. Sometimes she spoke like that, as if
she’d lived about twenty lives. It was a mistake, so they packed it in.

“What went wrong?”

“Nothing. We weren’t right for each other.”

Guillam didn’t believe her.

“Did you get a divorce?”

“I expect so.”

“Don’t be damn silly; you must know whether you’re divorced or not!”

His parents handled it, she said; he was foreign.

“Does he send you money?”

“Why should he? He doesn’t owe me anything.”

Then the flute again, in the spare room, long questioning notes in the half-
light while Guillam made coffee. Is she a fake or an angel? He’d half a mind to
pass her name across the records. She had a lesson with Sand in an hour.

Armed with a green slip with a 43 reference, he returned the two files to their
places and positioned himself at the alcove next to Testify.

Dry run uneventful, he thought.

The girl was still up her ladder. Allitson had vanished but the laundry basket
was still there. The radiator had already exhausted Astrid and he was sitting
beside it reading the Sun. The green slip read “4343,” and he found the file at
once because he had already marked it down. It had a pink jacket like Testify.
Like Testify, it was reasonably thumbed. He fitted the green slip into the bracket.
He moved back across the aisle, again checked Allitson and the girls, then
reached for the Testify file and replaced it very fast with the file he had in his
hand.

“I think the vital thing, Peter”—Smiley speaking—“is not to leave a gap. So
what I suggest is, you requisition a comparable file —physically comparable, I
mean—and pop it into the gap which is left by—”

“I get you,” Guillam said.

Holding the Testify file casually in his right hand, title inward to his body,
Guillam returned to the reading-room and again sat at his desk. Sal raised her
eyebrows and mouthed something. Guillam nodded that all was well, thinking
that was what she was asking, but she beckoned him over. Momentary panic.
Take the file with me or leave it? What do I usually do? He left it on the desk.

“Juliet’s going for coffee,” Sal whispered. “Want some?”

Guillam laid a shilling on the counter.

He glanced at the clock, then at his watch. Ghrist, stop looking at your damn
watch! Think of Gamilla, think of her starting her lesson, think of those aunts
you didn’t spend the weekend with, think of Alwyn not looking in your bag.
Think of anything but the time. Eighteen minutes to wait. “Peter, if you have the
smallest reservation, you really mustn’t go ahead with it. Nothing is as important
as that.” Great, so how do you spot a reservation when thirty teenage butterflies

are mating in your stomach and the sweat is like a secret rain inside your shirt?
Never, he swore, never had he had it this bad.

Opening the Testify file, he tried to read it.

It wasn’t all that thin, but it wasn’t fat, either. It looked pretty much like a
token volume, as Smiley had said: the first serial was taken up with a description
of what wasn’t there. “Annexes 1 to 8 held London Station, cross-refer to P.F.s
ELLIS Jim, PRIDEAUX Jim, HAJEK Vladimir, COLLINS Sam, HABOLT Max
...” and a whole football team besides. “For these files, consult H/London
Station or C.C.,” standing for Chief of Circus and his appointed mothers. Don’t
look at your watch; look at the clock and do the arithmetic, you idiot. Eight
minutes. Odd to be pinching files about one’s predecessor. Odd to have Jim as a
predecessor, come to think of it, and a secretary who held a wake over him
without ever mentioning his name. The only living trace Guillam had ever found
of him, apart from his workname on the files, was his squash racket jammed
behind the safe in his room, with “J.P.” hand-done in poker-work on the handle.
He showed it to Ellen, a tough old biddy who could make Cy Vanhofer quail like
a schoolboy, and she broke into floods of tears, wrapped it, and sent it to the
housekeepers by the next shuttle, with a personal note to the Dolphin insisting
that it be returned to him “if humanly possible.” How’s your game these days,
Jim, with a couple of Czech bullets in your shoulder-bone?

Still eight minutes.

“Now, if you could contrive,” said Smiley, “I mean if it wouldn’t be too much
bother, to take your car in for a service at your local garage. Using your home
phone to make the appointment, of course, in the hope that Toby is listening ...”

In the hope. Mother of Pearl. And all his cosy chats with Camilla? Still eight
minutes.

The rest of the file seemed to be Foreign Office telegrams, Czech press
cuttings, monitoring reports on Prague radio, extracts from a policy file on the
resettlement and rehabilitation of blown agents, draft submissions to the
Treasury, and a postmortem by Alleline that blamed Control for the fiasco.
Sooner you than me, George.

In his mind, Guillam began measuring the distance from his desk to the rear
door, where Alwyn dozed at the reception counter. He reckoned it was five paces
and he decided to make a tactical staging post. Two paces from the door stood a
chart chest like a big yellow piano. It was filled with oddments of reference:
large-scale maps, back copies of Who’s Who, old Baedekers. Putting a pencil
between his teeth, he picked up the Testify file, wandered to the chest, selected a
telephone directory of Warsaw, and began writing names on a sheet of paper. My
hand! a voice screamed inside him: my hand is shaking all over the page; look at

those figures—I might be drunk! Why has no one noticed? . . . The girl Juliet
came in with a tray and put a cup on his desk. He blew her a distracted kiss. He
selected another directory—he thought for Poznan—and laid it beside the first.
When Alwyn came through the door, he didn’t even look up.

“Telephone, sir,” he murmured.

“Oh, to hell,” said Guillam, deep in the directory. “Who is it?”

“Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, 1 think, regarding your car.

Said he’d got some bad news for you,” said Alwyn, very pleased.

Guillam was holding the Testify file in both hands, apparently cross-referring
with the directory. He had his back to Sal and he could feel his knees shaking
against his trouser legs. The pencil was still jammed in his mouth. Alwyn went
ahead and held the swing door for him, and he passed through it reading the file.
Like a damned choirboy, he thought. He waited for lightning to strike him, Sal to
call murder, old Ben the superspy to leap suddenly to life, but it didn’t happen.
He felt much better: Alwyn is my ally, 1 trust him, we are united against the
Dolphin, 1 can move. The swing doors closed; he went down the four steps and
there was Alwyn again, holding open the door to the telephone cubicle. The
lower part was panelled, the upper part glass. Lifting the receiver, he laid the file
at his feet and heard Mendel tell him he needed a new gear-box; the job could
cost anything up to a hundred quid. They’d worked this up for the benefit of the
housekeepers or whoever read the transcripts, and Guillam kept it going nicely
to and fro till Alwyn was safely behind his counter, listening like an eagle. It’s
working, he thought; I’m flying, it’s working after all. He heard himself say,
“Well, at least get on to the main agents first and find out how long they’ll take
to supply the damn thing. Have you got their number?” And irritably: “Hang
on.”

He half-opened the door and he kept the mouthpiece jammed against his
backside because he was very concerned that this part should not go on tape.
“Alwyn, chuck me that bag a minute, will you?”

Alwyn brought it over keenly, like the first-aid man at a football match. “All
right, Mr. Guillam, sir? Open it for you, sir?”

“Just dump it there, thanks.”

The bag was on the floor outside the cubicle. Now he stooped, dragged it
inside, and unzipped it. At the middle, among his shirts and a lot of newspaper,
were three dummy files, one buff, one green, one pink. He took out the pink
dummy and his address book and replaced them with the Testify file. He closed
the zip, and stood up and read Mendel a telephone number—actually the right
one. He rang off, handed Alwyn the bag, and returned to the reading-room with
the dummy file. He dawdled at the chart chest, fiddled with a couple more

directories, then sauntered to the archive carrying the dummy file. Allitson was
going through a comedy routine, first pulling then pushing the laundry basket.

“Peter, give us a hand, will you—I’m stuck.”

“Half a sec.”

Recovering the 43 file from the Testify pigeon-hole, he replaced it with the
dummy, restored it to its rightful place in the 43 alcove, and removed the green
slip from the bracket. God is in His heaven and the first night was a wow. He
could have sung out loud: God is in His heaven and I can still fly.

He took the slip to Sal, who signed it and put it on a spike as she always did.
Later today she would check. If the file was in its place, she would destroy both
the green slip and the flimsy from the box, and not even clever Sal would
remember that he had been alongside the 44 alcove. He was about to return to
the archive to give old Allitson a hand when he found himself looking straight
into the brown, unfriendly eyes of Toby Esterhase.

“Peter,” said Toby, in his not quite perfect English. “I am so sorry to disturb
you but we have a tiny crisis and Percy Alleline would like quite an urgent word
with you. Gan you come now? That would be very kind.” And at the door, as
Alwyn let them out: “Your opinion he wants, actually,” he remarked with the
officiousness of a small but rising man. “He wishes to consult you for an
opinion.”

In a desperately inspired moment, Guillam turned to Alwyn and said, “There’s
a midday shuttle to Brixton. You might just give transport a buzz and ask them to
take that thing over for me, will you?”

“Will do, sir,” said Alwyn. “Will do. Mind the step, sir.”

And you pray for me, thought Guillam.

21

“Our Shadow Foreign Secretary,” Haydon called him. The janitors called him
“Snow White” because of his hair. Toby Esterhase dressed like a male model,
but the moment he dropped his shoulders or closed his tiny fists he was
unmistakably a fighter. Following him down the fourth-floor corridor—noting
the coffee machine again, and Lauder Strickland’s voice explaining that he was
unobtainable—Guillam thought, Christ, we’re back in Berne and on the run.

He’d half a mind to call this out to Toby, but decided the comparison was
unwise.

Whenever he thought of Toby, that was what he thought of: Switzerland eight
years ago, when Toby was just a humdrum watcher with a growing reputation
for informal listening on the side. Guillam was kicking his heels after North
Africa, so the Circus packed them both off to Berne on a one-time operation to
spike a pair of Belgian arms dealers who were using the Swiss to spread their
wares in unpopular directions. They rented a villa next door to the target house,
and the following night Toby opened up a junction box and rearranged things so
that they overheard the Belgians’ conversations on their own phone. Guillam
was boss and legman, and twice a day he dropped the tapes on the Berne
residency, using a parked car as a letter-box. With the same ease, Toby bribed the
local postman to give him a first sight of the Belgians’ mail before he delivered
it, and the cleaning lady to plant a radio mike in the drawing room where they
held most of their discussions. For diversion, they went to the Chikito and Toby
danced with the youngest girls. Now and then he brought one home, but by
morning she was always gone and Toby had the windows open to get rid of the
smell.

They lived this way for three months and Guillam knew him no better at the
end than he had on the first day. He didn’t even know his country of origin. Toby
was a snob, and knew the places to eat and be seen. He washed his own clothes
and at night he wore a net over his snow white hair, and on the day the police hit
the villa and Guillam had to hop over the back wall, he found Toby at the
Bellevue Hotel munching patisseries and watching the the dansant. He listened
to what Guillam had to say, paid his bill, tipped first the bandleader, then Franz,
the head porter, and then led the way along a succession of corridors and
staircases to the underground garage where he had cached the escape car and
passports. There also, punctiliously, he asked for his bill. Guillam thought. If you
ever want to get out of Switzerland in a hurry, you pay your bills first. The

corridors were endless, with mirror walls and Versailles chandeliers, so that
Guillam was following not just one Esterhase but a whole delegation of them.

It was this vision that came back to him now, though the narrow wooden
staircase to Alleline’s rooms was painted mud-green and only a battered
parchment lampshade recalled the chandeliers.

“To see the Chief,” Toby announced portentously to the young janitor who
beckoned them through with an insolent nod. In the anteroom at four grey
typewriters sat the four grey mothers, in pearls and twin-sets. They nodded to
Guillam and ignored Toby. A sign over Alleline’s door said “Engaged.” Beside
it, a six-foot wardrobe safe, new. Guillam wondered how on earth the floor took
the strain. On its top, bottles of South African sherry; glasses, plates. Tuesday, he
remembered: London Station’s informal lunch meeting.

“I’ll have no phone calls, tell them,” Alleline shouted as Toby opened the
door.

“The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies,” said Toby elaborately, holding
back the door for Guillam. “We are having a conference.”

One of the mothers said, “We heard.”

It was a war party.

Alleline sat at the head of the table in the megalomaniac’s throne, reading a
two-page document, and he didn’t stir when Guillam came in. He just growled,
“Down there with you. By Paul. Below the salt,” and went on reading with
heavy concentration.

The chair to Alleline’s right was empty, and Guillam knew it was Haydon’s by
the posture-curve cushion tied to it with string. To Alleline’s left sat Roy Bland,
also reading, but he looked up as Guillam passed, and said “Wotcher, Peter,”
then followed him all the way down the table with his bulging eyes. Next to
Bill’s empty chair sat Mo Delaware, London Station’s token woman, in bobbed
hair and a brown tweed suit. Across from her, Phil Porteous, the head
housekeeper, a rich servile man with a big house in suburbia. When he saw
Guillam, he stopped his reading altogether, ostentatiously closed the folder, laid
his sleek hands over it, and smirked.

“ 'Below the salt’ means next to Paul Skordeno,” said Phil, still smirking.

“Thanks. I can see it.”

Across from Porteous came Bill’s Russians, last seen in the fourth-floor men’s
room, Nick de Silsky and his boyfriend Kaspar. They couldn’t smile, and for all
Guillam knew they couldn’t read, either, because they had no papers in front of
them; they were the only ones who hadn’t. They sat with their four thick hands
on the table as if somebody were holding a gun behind them, and they just

watched him with their four brown eyes.

Downhill from Porteous sat Paul Skordeno, now reputedly Roy Bland’s
fieldman on the satellite networks, though others said he ran between wickets for
Bill. Paul was thin and mean and forty, with a pitted brown face and long arms.
Guillam had once paired with him on a tough-guy course at the Nursery and they
all but killed each other.

Guillam moved the chair away from him and sat down, so Toby sat next along
like the other half of a bodyguard. Guillam thought. What the hell do they expect
me to do—make a mad dash for freedom? Everyone was watching Alleline fill
his pipe when Bill Haydon upstaged him. The door opened and at first no one
came in. Then a slow shuffle and Bill appeared, clutching a cup of coffee in both
hands, the saucer on top. He had a striped folder jammed under his arm and his
glasses were over his nose, for a change, so he must have done his reading
elsewhere. They’ve all been reading it except me, thought Guillam, and I don’t
know what it is. He wondered whether it was the same document that Esterhase
and Roy were reading yesterday, and decided on no evidence at all that it was;
that yesterday it had just come in, that Toby had brought it to Roy, and that he
had disturbed them in their first excitement—if excitement was the word.

Alleline had still not looked up. Down the table Guillam had only his rich
black hair to look at, and a pair of broad tweedy shoulders. Mo Delaware was
pulling at her fringe while she read. Percy had two wives, Guillam remembered,
as Gamilla once more flitted through his teeming mind, and both were
alcoholics, which must mean something. He had met only the London edition.
Percy was forming his supporters’ club and gave a drinks party at his sprawling
panelled flat in Buckingham Palace Mansions. Guillam arrived late and he was
taking off his coat in the lobby when a pale blond woman loomed timidly
towards him holding out her hands. He took her for the maid wanting his coat.

“I’m Joy,” she said, in a theatrical voice, like “I’m Virtue” or “I’m
Gontinence.” It wasn’t his coat she wanted but a kiss. Yielding to it, Guillam
inhaled the joint pleasures of Je Reviens and a high concentration of inexpensive
sherry.

“Well, now, young Peter Guillam”—Alleline speaking—“are you ready for
me finally or have you other calls to make about my house?” He half looked up
and Guillam noticed two tiny triangles of fur on each weathered cheek. “What
are you getting up to out there in the sticks these days”—turning a page—“apart
from chasing the local virgins, if there are any in Brixton, which I severely doubt
—if you’ll pardon my freedom. Mo—and wasting public money on expensive
lunches?”

This banter was Alleline’s one instrument of communication; it could be

friendly or hostile, reproachful or congratulatory, but in the end it was like a
constant tapping on the same spot.

“Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Cy Vanhofer’s got a lead to a
German diplomat. That’s about it.”

“Arabs,” Alleline repeated, pushing aside the folder and dragging a rough pipe
from his pocket. “Any bloody fool can burn an Arab—can’t he. Bill? Buy a
whole damn Arab Cabinet for half a crown, if you’ve a mind to.” From another
pocket Alleline took a tobacco pouch, which he tossed easily onto the table. “I
hear you’ve been hobnobbing with our late-lamented Brother Tarr. How is he
these days?”

A lot of things went through Guillam’s mind as he heard himself answer. That
the surveillance on his flat did not begin till last night—he was sure of it. That
over the weekend he was in the clear unless Fawn, the captive baby-sitter, had
doubled, which would have been hard for him. That Roy Bland bore a close
resemblance to the late Dylan Thomas: Roy had always reminded him of
someone and till this moment he’d never been able to pin down the connection;
and that Mo Delaware had only passed muster as a woman because of her
brownie mannishness. He wondered whether Dylan Thomas had had Roy’s
extraordinary blue eyes. That Toby Esterhase was helping himself to a cigarette
from his gold case, and that Alleline didn’t as a rule allow cigarettes but only
pipes, so Toby must stand pretty well with Alleline just now. That Bill Haydon
was looking strangely young and that Circus rumours about his love-life were
not after all so laughable: they said he went both ways. That Paul Skordeno had
one brown palm flat on the table and the thumb slightly lifted in a way that
hardened the hitting surface on the outside of the hand. He thought also of his
canvas case: had Alwyn put it on the shuttle? Or had he gone off for his lunch
leaving it in Registry, waiting to be inspected by one of the new young janitors
busting for promotion? And Guillam wondered—not for the first time—^just how
long Toby had been hanging around Registry before Guillam noticed him.

He selected a facetious tone: “That’s right. Chief. Tarr and I have tea at
Fortnum’s every afternoon.”

Alleline was sucking at his empty pipe, testing the packing of the tobacco.

“Peter Guillam,” he said deliberately, in his pert brogue. “You may not be
aware of this, but I am of an extremely forgiving nature. I am positively seething
with goodwill, in fact. All I require is the matter of your discussion with Tarr. I
do not ask for his head, nor any other part of his damned anatomy, and I will
restrain my impulse personally to strangle him. Or you.” He struck a match and
lit his pipe, making a monstrous flame. “I would even go so far as to consider
hanging a gold chain about your neck and bringing you into the palace from

hateful Brixton.”

“In that case, I can’t wait for him to turn up,” said Guillam.

“And there’s a free pardon for Tarr till I get my hands on him.”

“I’ll tell him. He’ll be thrilled.”

A great cloud of smoke rolled out over the table.

“I’m very disappointed with you, young Peter. Giving ear to gross slanders of
a divisive and insidious nature. I pay you honest money and you stab me in the
back. I consider that extremely poor reward for keeping you alive. Against the
entreaties of my advisers, I may tell you.”

Alleline had a new mannerism, one that Guillam had noticed often in vain
men of middle age: it involved taking hold of a tuck of flesh under the chin and
massaging it between finger and thumb in the hope of reducing it.

“Tell us some more about Tarr’s circumstances just now,” said Alleline. “Tell
us about his emotional state. He has a daughter, has he not? A wee daughter
name of Danny. Does he talk of her at all?”

“He used to.”

“Regale us with some anecdotes about her.”

“I don’t know any. He was very fond of her, that’s all I know.”

“Obsessively fond?” His voice rose suddenly in anger. “What’s that shrug for?
What the hell are you shrugging at me like that for? I’m talking to you about a
defector from your own damn section; I’m accusing you of playing hookey with
him behind my back, of taking part in damn-fool parlour games when you don’t
know the stakes involved, and all you do is shrug at me down the table. There’s a
law, Peter Guillam, against consorting with enemy agents. Maybe you didn’t
know that. I’ve a good mind to throw the book at you!”

“But I haven’t been seeing him,” said Guillam as anger came also to his
rescue. “It’s not me who’s playing parlour games. It’s you. So get off my back.”

In the same moment he sensed the relaxation round the table, like a tiny
descent into boredom, like a general recognition that Alleline had shot off all his
ammunition and the target was unmarked. Skordeno was fidgeting with a bit of
ivory, some lucky charm he carried round with him. Bland was reading again
and Bill Haydon was drinking his coffee and finding it terrible, for he made a
sour face at Mo Delaware and put down the cup. Toby Esterhase, chin in hand,
had raised his eyebrows and was gazing at the red cellophane that filled the
Victorian grate. Only the Russians continued to watch him unblinkingly, like a
pair of terriers not wanting to believe that the hunt was over.

“So he used to chat to you about Danny, eh? And he told you he loved her,”
said Alleline, back at the document before him. “Who’s Danny’s mother?”

“A Eurasian girl.”

Now Haydon spoke for the first time. “Unmistakably Eurasian, or could she
pass for something nearer home?”

“Tarr seems to think she looks full European. He thinks the kid does, too.”

Alleline read aloud: “Twelve years old, long blond hair, brown eyes, slim. Is
that Danny?”

“I should think it could be. It sounds like her.”

There was a long silence and not even Haydon seemed inclined to break it.

“So if I told you,” Alleline resumed, choosing his words extremely carefully:
“if I told you that Danny and her mother were due to arrive three days ago at
London Airport on the direct flight from Singapore, I may take it you would
share our perplexity.”

“Yes, I would.”

“You would also keep your mouth shut when you got out of here. You’d tell
no one but your twelve best friends?”

From not far away came Phil Porteous’s purr: “The source is extremely secret,
Peter. It may sound to you like ordinary flight information but it isn’t that at all.
It’s ultra, ultra sensitive.”

“Ah, well, in that case I’ll try to keep my mouth ultra shut,” said Guillam to
Porteous, and while Porteous coloured Bill Haydon gave another schoolboy grin.

Alleline came back. “So what would you make of this information? Come on,
Peter—” the banter again—“Come on, you were his boss, his guide, philosopher,
and his friend. Where’s your psychology, for God’s sake? Why is Tarr coming to
England?”

“That’s not what you said at all. You said Tarr’s girl and her daughter Danny
were expected in London three days ago. Perhaps she’s visiting relations.

Perhaps she’s got a new boyfriend. How should I know?”

“Don’t be obtuse, man. Doesn’t it occur to you that where little Danny is, Tarr
himself is unlikely to be far behind? If he’s not here already, which I’m inclined
to believe he is, that being the manner of men to come first and bring their
impedimenta later. Pardon me. Mo Delaware, a lapse.”

For the second time, Guillam allowed himself a little temperament. “Till now
it had not occurred to me, no. Till now Tarr was a defector. Housekeepers’ ruling
as of seven months ago. Right or wrong, Phil? Tarr was sitting in Moscow and
everything he knew should be regarded as blown. Right, Phil? That was also
held to be a good enough reason for turning the lights out in Brixton and giving
one chunk of our workload to London Station and another to Toby’s
lamplighters. What’s Tarr supposed to be doing now, redefecting to us?”

“Redefecting would be a damned charitable way of putting it. I’ll tell you that
for nothing,” Alleline retorted, back at the paper before him. “Listen to me.

Listen exactly, and remember. Because I’ve no doubt that, like the rest of my
staff, you’ve a memory like a sieve—all you prima donnas are the same. Danny
and her mother are travelling on fake British passports in the name of Poole, like
the harbour. The passports are Russian fakes. A third went to Tarr himself, the
well-known Mr. Poole. Tarr is already in England but we don’t know where. He
left ahead of Danny and her mother and came here by a different route; our
investigations suggest a black one. He instructed his wife or mistress or
whatever”—he said this as if he had neither—“pardon again. Mo, to follow him
in one week, which they have not yet done, apparently. This information only
reached us yesterday, so we’ve a lot of footwork to do yet. Tarr instructed them,
Danny and her mother, that if by any chance he failed to make contact with
them, they should throw themselves on the mercy of one Peter Guillam. That’s
you, I believe.”

“If they were due three days ago, what’s happened to them?”

“Delayed. Missed their plane. Changed their plans. Lost their tickets. How the
hell do I know?”

“Or else the information’s wrong,” Guillam suggested.

“It isn’t,” Alleline snapped.

Resentment, mystification: Guillam clung to them both. “All right. The
Russians have turned Tarr round. They’ve sent his family over—God knows
why; I’d have thought they’d put them in the bank—and they’ve sent him, too.
Why’s it all so hot? What sort of plant can he be when we don’t believe a word
he says?”

This time, he noticed with exhilaration, his audience was watching Alleline,
who seemed to Guillam to be torn between giving a satisfactory but indiscreet
answer or making a fool of himself.

“Never mind what sort of plant! Muddying pools. Poisoning wells, maybe.
That damn sort. Pulling the rug out when we’re all but home and dry.” His
circulars read that way, too, thought Guillam. Metaphors chasing each other off
the page. “But just you remember this. At the first peep, before the first peep, at
the first whisper of him or his lady or his wee daughter, young Peter Guillam,
you come to one of us grown-ups. Anyone you see at this table. But not another
damn soul. Do you follow that injunction perfectly? Because there are more
damn wheels within wheels here than you can possibly guess or have any right
to know...”

It became suddenly a conversation in movement. Bland had plugged his hands
into his pockets and slouched across the room to lean against the far door.
Alleline had relit his pipe and was putting out the match with a long movement
of his arm while he glowered at Guillam through the smoke. “Who are you

courting these days, Peter—who’s the lucky wee lady?” Porteous was sliding a
sheet of paper down the table for Guillam’s signature. “For you, Peter, if you
please.” Paul Skordeno was whispering something into the ear of one of the
Russians, and Esterhase was at the door giving unpopular orders to the mothers.
Only Mo Delaware’s brown, unassuming eyes still held Guillam in their gaze.

“Read it first, won’t you,” Porteous advised silkily.

Guillam was halfway through the form already: “I certify that I have today
been advised of the contents of Witchcraft Report No. 308, Source Merlin,” ran
the first paragraph. “I undertake not to divulge any part of this report to other
members of the service, nor will I divulge the existence of Source Merlin. I also
undertake to report at once any matter which comes to my notice which appears
to bear on this material.”

The door had stayed open and, as Guillam signed, the second echelon of
London Station filed in, led by the mothers with trays of sandwiches. Diana
Dolphin, Lauder Strickland looking taut enough to blow up, the girls from
distribution, and a sour-faced old war-horse called Haggard, who was Ben
Thruxton’s overlord. Guillam left slowly, counting heads because he knew
Smiley would want to know who was there. At the door, to his surprise, he found
himself joined by Haydon, who seemed to have decided that the remaining
festivities were not for him.

“Stupid bloody cabaret,” Bill remarked, waving vaguely at the mothers.
“Percy’s getting more insufferable every day.”

“He does seem to,” said Guillam heartily.

“How’s Smiley these days? Seen much of him? You used to be quite a chum
of his, didn’t you?”

Guillam’s world, which was showing signs till then of steadying to a sensible
pace, plunged violently. “Afraid not,” he said; “he’s out of bounds.”

“Don’t tell me you take any notice of that nonsense,” Bill said, snorting. They
had reached the stairs. Haydon went ahead.

“How about you?” Guillam called. “Have you seen much of him?”

“And Ann’s flown the coop,” said Bill, ignoring the question. “Pushed off
with a sailor-boy or a waiter or something.” The door to his room was wide
open, the desk heaped with secret files. “Is that right?”

“I didn’t know,” said Guillam. “Poor old George.”

“Goffee?”

“I think I’ll get back, thanks.”

“For tea with Brother Tarr?”

“That’s right. At Fortnum’s. So long.”

In Archives Section, Alwyn was back from lunch. “Bag’s all gone, sir,” he

said gaily. “Should be over in Brixton by now.”

“Oh, damn,” said Guillam, firing his last shot. “There was something in it I
needed.”

A sickening notion had struck him: it seemed so neat and so horribly obvious
that he could only wonder why it had come to him so late. Sand was Camilla’s
husband. She was living a double life. Now whole new vistas of deceit opened
before him. His friends, his loves, even the Circus itself; joined and re-formed in
endless patterns of intrigue. A line of Mendel’s came back to him, dropped two
nights ago as they drank beer in some glum suburban pub: “Cheer up, Peter, old
son. Jesus Christ only had twelve, you know, and one of them was a double.”

Tarr, he thought. That bastard Ricki Tarr.

22

The bedroom was long and low, once a maid’s room, built into the attic. Guillam
was standing at the door; Tarr sat on the bed motionless, his head tilted back
against the sloped ceiling, hands to either side of him, fingers wide. There was a
dormer window above him, and from where Guillam stood he could see long
reaches of black Suffolk countryside and a line of black trees traced against the
sky. The wallpaper was brown with large red flowers. The one light hung from a
black oak truss, lighting their two faces in strange geometric patterns, and when
either one of them moved, Tarr on the bed or Smiley on the wooden kitchen
chair, they seemed by their movement to take the light with them a distance
before it resettled.

Left to himself, Guillam would have been very rough with Tarr, he had no
doubt of it. His nerves were all over the place, and on the drive down he had
touched ninety before Smiley sharply told him to go steady. Left to himself, he
would have been tempted to beat the daylights out of Tarr, and if necessary he
would have brought Fawn in to lend a hand; driving, he had a very clear picture
of opening the front door of wherever Tarr lived and hitting him in the face
several times, with love from Gamilla and her ex-husband, the distinguished
doctor of the flute. And perhaps in the shared tension of the journey Smiley had
received the same picture telepathically, for the little he said was clearly directed
to talking Guillam down. “Tarr has not lied to us, Peter. Not in any material way.
He has simply done what agents do the world over: he has failed to tell us the
whole story. On the other hand, he has been rather clever.” Far from sharing
Guillam’s bewilderment, he seemed curiously confident—even complacent—to
the extent of allowing himself a sententious aphorism from Steed-Asprey on the
arts of double-cross; something about not looking for perfection, but for
advantage, which again had Guillam thinking about Gamilla. “Karla has
admitted us to the inner circle,” Smiley announced, and Guillam made a bad
joke about changing at Gharing Gross. After that Smiley contented himself with
giving directions and watching the wing mirror.

They had met at Grystal Palace, a van pick-up with Mendel driving. They
drove to Barnsbury, straight into a car-body repair shop at the end of a cobbled
alley full of children. There they were received with discreet rapture by an old
German and his son, who had stripped the plates off the van almost before they
got out of it and led them to a souped-up Vauxhall ready to drive out of the far
end of the workshop. Mendel stayed behind with the Testify file, which Guillam

had brought from Brixton in his night-bag; Smiley said, “Find the A12.” There
was very little traffic but short of Colchester they hit a cluster of lorries and
Guillam suddenly lost patience. Smiley had to order him to pull in. Once they
met an old man driving at twenty in the fast lane. As they overtook him on the
inside, he veered wildly towards them, drunk or ill, or just terrified. And once,
with no warning, they hit a fog wall; it seemed to fall on them from above.
Guillam drove clean through it, afraid to brake because of black ice. Past
Colchester they took small lanes. On the signposts were names like Little
Horkesley, Wormingford, and Bures Green; then the signposts stopped and
Guillam had a feeling of being nowhere at all.

“Left here and left again at the dower house. Go as far as you can but park
short of the gates.”

They reached what seemed to be a hamlet but there were no lights, no people,
and no moon. As they got out, the cold hit them and Guillam smelt a cricket field
and wood-smoke and Christmas all at once; he thought he had never been
anywhere so quiet or so cold or so remote. A church tower rose ahead of them, a
white fence ran to one side, and up on the slope stood what he took to be the
rectory, a low rambling house, part thatched; he could make out the fringe of
gable against the sky. Fawn was waiting for them; he came to the car as they
parked, and climbed silently into the back.

“Ricki’s been that much better today, sir,” he reported. He had evidently done
a lot of reporting to Smiley in the last few days. He was a steady, soft-spoken
boy with a great will to please, but the rest of the Brixton pack seemed to be
afraid of him, Guillam didn’t know why. “Not so nervy—more relaxed. I’d say.
Did his pools this morning—loves the pools, Ricki does—this afternoon we dug
up fir trees for Miss Ailsa, so’s she could drive them into market. This evening
we had a nice game of cards and early bed.”

“Has he been out alone?” asked Smiley.

“No, sir.”

“Has he used the telephone?”

“Gracious, no, sir, not while I’m around, and I’m sure not while Miss Ailsa
was, either.”

Their breath had misted the windows of the car, but Smiley would not have
the engine on, so there was no heater and no de-mister.

“Has he mentioned his daughter Danny?”

“Over the weekend he did a lot. Now he’s sort of cooled off about them. I
think he’s shut them out of his mind, in view of the emotional side.”

“He hasn’t talked about seeing them again?”

“No, sir.”

“Nothing about arrangements for meeting when all this is over?”

“No, sir.”

“Or bringing them to England?”

“No, sir.”

“Nor about providing them with documents?”

“No, sir.”

Guillam chimed in irritably: “So what has he talked about, for heaven’s sake?”

“The Russian lady, sir. Irina. He likes to read her diary. He says when the
mole’s caught, he’s going to make Centre swap him for Irina. Then we’ll get her
a nice place, sir—like Miss Ailsa’s but up in Scotland where it’s nicer. He says
he’ll see me right, too. Give me a big job in the Circus. He’s been encouraging
me to learn another language to increase my scope.”

There was no telling, from the flat voice behind them in the dark, what Fawn
made of this advice.

“Where is he now?”

“In bed, sir.”

“Close the doors quietly.”

Ailsa Brimley was waiting in the front porch for them: a grey-haired lady of
sixty with a firm, intelligent face. She was old Circus, Smiley said, one of Lord
Landsbury’s coding ladies from the war, now in retirement but still formidable.
She wore a trim brown suit. She shook Guillam by the hand and said “How do
you do,” bolted the door, and when he looked again she had gone. Smiley led the
way upstairs. Fawn should wait on the lower landing in case he was needed.

“It’s Smiley,” he said knocking on Tarr’s door. “I want a chat with you.”

Tarr opened the door fast. He must have heard them coming, and been waiting
just the other side. He opened it with his left hand, holding the gun in his right,
and he was looking past Smiley down the corridor.

“It’s only Guillam,” said Smiley.

“That’s what I mean,” said Tarr. “Babies can bite.”

They stepped inside. He wore slacks and some sort of cheap Malay wrap.
Spelling cards lay spread over the floor and in the air hung a smell of curry that
he had cooked for himself on a ring.

“I’m sorry to be pestering you,” said Smiley with an air of sincere
commiseration. “But I must ask you again what you did with those two Swiss
escape passports you took with you to Hong Kong.”

“Why?” said Tarr at last.

The jauntiness was all gone. He had a prison pallor; he had lost weight and as
he sat on the bed with the gun on the pillow beside him, his eyes sought them out
nervously, each in turn, trusting nothing.

Smiley said, “Listen. I want to believe your story. Nothing is altered. Once we
know, we’ll respect your privacy. But we have to know. It’s terribly important.
Your whole future stands by it.”

And a lot more besides, thought Guillam, watching; a whole chunk of devious
arithmetic was hanging by a thread, if Guillam knew Smiley at all.

“I told you I burned them. I didn’t fancy the numbers. I reckoned they were
blown. Might as well put a label round your neck Tarr, Ricki Tarr, Wanted’ soon
as use those passports.”

Smiley’s questions were terribly slow in coming. Even to Guillam it was
painful waiting for them in the deep silence of the night.

“What did you burn them with?”

“What the hell does that matter?”

But Smiley apparently did not feel like giving reasons for his enquiries; he
preferred to let the silence do its work, and he seemed confident that it would.
Guillam had seen whole interrogations conducted that way: a laboured catechism
swathed in deep coverings of routine; wearying pauses as each answer was
written down in longhand and the suspect’s brain besieged itself with a thousand
questions to the interrogator’s one; and his hold on his story weakened from day
to day.

“When you bought your British passport in the name of Poole,” Smiley asked,
after another age, “did you buy any other passports from the same source?”

“Why should I?”

But Smiley did not feel like giving reasons.

“Why should I?” Tarr repeated. “I’m not a damn collector, for Ghrist’s sake;
all I wanted was to get out from under.”

“And protect your child,” Smiley suggested, with an understanding smile.
“And protect her mother, too, if you could. I’m sure you gave a lot of thought to
that,” he said in a flattering tone. “After all, you could hardly leave them behind
to the mercy of that inquisitive Frenchman, could you?”

Waiting, Smiley appeared to examine the lexicon cards, reading off the words
longways and sideways. There was nothing to them: they were random words.
One was misspelt; Guillam noticed “epistle” with the last two letters back to
front. What’s he been doing up there, Guillam wondered, in that stinking flea-pit
of a hotel? What furtive little tracks has his mind been following, locked away
with the sauce bottles and the commercial travellers?

“All right,” said Tarr sullenly, “so I got passports for Danny and her mother.
Mrs. Poole, Miss Danny Poole. What do we do now, cry out in ecstasy?”

Again it was the silence that accused.

“Now why didn’t you tell us that before?” Smiley asked in the tone of a

disappointed father. “We’re not monsters. We don’t wish them harm. Why didn’t
you tell us? Perhaps we could even have helped you,” and went back to his
examination of the cards. Tarr must have used two or three packs; they lay in
rivers over the coconut carpet. “Why didn’t you tell us?” he repeated. “There’s
no crime in looking after the people one loves.”

If they’ll let you, thought Guillam, with Camilla in mind. To help Tarr answer,
Smiley was making helpful suggestions: “Was it because you dipped into your
operational expenses to buy these British passports? Was that the reason you
didn’t tell us? Good heavens, no one here is worried about money. You’ve
brought us a vital piece of information. Why should we quarrel about a couple of
thousand dollars?” And the time ticked away again without anyone using it.

“Or was it,” Smiley suggested, “that you were ashamed?”

Guillam stiffened, his own problems forgotten.

“Rightly ashamed in a way, I suppose. It wasn’t a very gallant act, after all, to
leave Danny and her mother with blown passports, at the mercy of that so-called
Frenchman who was looking so hard for Mr. Poole? While you yourself escaped
to all this V.I.P. treatment? It is horrible to think of,” Smiley agreed, as if Tarr,
not he, had made the point. “It is horrible to contemplate the lengths Karla would
go to in order to obtain your silence. Or your services.”

The sweat on Tarr’s face was suddenly unbearable. There was too much of it;
it was like tears all over. The cards no longer interested Smiley; his eye had
settled on a different game. It was a toy, made of two steel rods like the shafts of
a pair of tongs. The trick was to roll a steel ball along them. The further you
rolled it, the more points you won when it fell into one of the holes underneath.

“The other reason you might not have told us, I suppose, is that you burnt
them. You burnt the British passports, I mean, not the Swiss ones.”

Go easy, George, thought Guillam, and softly moved a pace nearer to cover
the gap between them. Just go easy.

“You knew that Poole was blown, so you burnt the Poole passports you had
bought for Danny and her mother, but you kept your own because there was no
alternative. Then you made travel bookings for the two of them in the name of
Poole in order to convince everybody that you still believed in the Poole
passports. By everybody, I think I mean Karla’s footpads, don’t I? You doctored
the Swiss escapes, one for Danny, one for her mother, took a chance that the
numbers wouldn’t be noticed, and you made a different set of arrangements
which you didn’t advertise. Arrangements which matured earlier than those you
made for the Pooles. How would that be? Such as staying out East, but
somewhere else, like Djakarta: somewhere you have friends.”

Even from where he stood, Guillam was too slow. Tarr’s hands were at

Smiley’s throat; the chair toppled and Tarr fell with him. From the heap, Guillam
selected Tarr’s right arm and flung it into a lock against his back, bringing it very
near to breaking as he did so. From nowhere Fawn appeared, took the gun from
the pillow, and walked back to Tarr as if to give him a hand. Then Smiley was
straightening his suit and Tarr was back on the bed, dabbing the corner of his
mouth with a handkerchief.

Smiley said, “I don’t know where they are. As far as I know, no harm has
come to them. You believe that, do you?”

Tarr was staring at him, waiting. His eyes were furious, but over Smiley a kind
of calm had settled, and Guillam guessed it was the reassurance he had been
hoping for.

“Maybe you should keep a better eye on your own damn woman and leave
mine alone,” Tarr whispered, his hand across his mouth. With an exclamation,
Guillam sprang forward but Smiley restrained him.

“As long as you don’t try to communicate with them,” Smiley continued, “it’s
probably better that I shouldn’t know. Unless you want me to do something
about them. Money or protection or comfort of some sort?”

Tarr shook his head. There was blood in his mouth, a lot of it, and Guillam
realised Fawn must have hit him but he couldn’t work out when.

“It won’t be long now,” Smiley said. “Perhaps a week. Less, if I can manage
it. Try not to think too much.”

By the time they left, Tarr was grinning again, so Guillam guessed that the
visit, or the insult to Smiley or the smash in the face, had done him good.

“Those football-pool coupons,” Smiley said quietly to Fawn as they climbed
into the car: “You don’t post them anywhere, do you?”

“No, sir.”

“Well, let’s hope to God he doesn’t have a win,” Smiley remarked in a most
unusual fit of jocularity, and there was laughter all round.

The memory plays strange tricks on an exhausted, overladen brain. As
Guillam drove, one part of his conscious mind upon the road and another still
wretchedly grappling with even more gothic suspicions of Gamilla, odd images
of this and other long days drifted freely through his memory. Days of plain
terror in Morocco as one by one his agent lines went dead on him, and every
footfall on the stair had him scurrying to the window to check the street; days of
idleness in Brixton when he watched that poor world slip by and wondered how
long before he joined it. And suddenly the written report was there before him
on his desk: duplicated on blue flimsy because it was traded, source unknown,
and probably unreliable, and every word of it came back to him in letters a foot
high:

According to a recently released prisoner from Lubianka, Moscow
Centre held a secret execution in the punishment block in July. The
victims were three of its own functionaries. One was a woman. All three
were shot in the back of the neck.

“It was stamped 'internal/ ” Guillam said dully. They had parked in a layby
beside a roadhouse hung with fairy lights. “Somebody from London Station had
scribbled on it: 'Can anyone identify the bodies?’ ”

By the coloured glow of the lights, Guillam watched Smiley’s face pucker in
disgust.

“Yes,” he agreed at last. “Yes, well now, the woman was Irina, wasn’t she?
Then there was Ivlov and then there was Boris, her husband, I suppose.” His
voice remained extremely matter-of-fact. “Tarr mustn’t know,” he continued, as
if shaking off lassitude. “It is vital that he should have no wind of this. God
knows what he would do, or not do, if he knew that Irina was dead.” For some
moments neither moved; perhaps for their different reasons neither had the
strength just then, or the heart.

“I ought to telephone,” said Smiley, but he made no attempt to leave the car.

“George?”

“I have a phone call to make,” Smiley muttered. “Lacon.”

“Then make it.”

Reaching across him, Guillam pushed open the door. Smiley clambered,
walked a distance over the tarmac, then seemed to change his mind and came
back.

“Come and eat something,” he said through the window, in the same
preoccupied tone. “I don’t think even Toby’s people would follow us in here.”

It was once a restaurant, now a transport cafe with trappings of old grandeur.
The menu was bound in red leather and stained with grease. The boy who
brought it was half asleep.

“I hear the coq au vin is always reliable,” said Smiley, with a poor effort at
humour as he returned from the telephone booth in the corner. And in a quieter
voice, that fell short and echoed nowhere: “Tell me, how much do you know
about Karla?”

“About as much as I know about Witchcraft and Source Merlin, and whatever
else it said on the paper I signed for Porteous.”

“Ah, well, now, that’s a very good answer, as it happens. You meant it as a
rebuke, I expect, but as it happens, the analogy was most apt.” The boy
reappeared, swinging a bottle of Burgundy like an Indian club. “Would you
please let it breathe a little?”

The boy stared at Smiley as if he were mad.

“Open it and leave it on the table,” said Guillam curtly.

It was not the whole story Smiley told. Afterwards Guillam did notice several
gaps. But it was enough to lift his spirits from the doldrums where they had
strayed.

23

“It is the business of agent runners to turn themselves into legends,” Smiley
began, rather as if he were delivering a trainee lecture at the Nursery. “They do
this first to impress their agents. Later they try it out on their colleagues and, in
my personal experience, make rare asses of themselves in consequence. A few
go so far as to try it on themselves. Those are the charlatans and they must be got
rid of quickly, there’s no other way.”

Yet legends were made and Karla was one of them. Even his age was a
mystery. Most likely Karla was not his real name. Decades of his life were not
accounted for, and probably never would be, since the people he worked with
had a way of dying off or keeping their mouths shut.

“There’s a story that his father was in the Okhrana and later reappeared in the
Cheka. I don’t think it’s true but it may be. There’s another that he worked as a
kitchen boy on an armoured train against Japanese Occupation troops in the
East. He is said to have learnt his tradecraft from Berg—to have been his ewe
lamb, in fact—which is a bit like being taught music by ... oh, name a great
composer. So far as I am concerned, his career began in Spain in 1936, because
that at least is documented. He posed as a White Russian journalist in the Franco
cause and recruited a stable of German agents. It was a most intricate operation,
and for a young man remarkable. He popped up next in the Soviet counter¬
offensive against Smolensk in the autumn of 1941 as an intelligence officer
under Konev. He had the job of running networks of partisans behind the
German lines. Along the way he discovered that his radio operator had been
turned round and was transmitting radio messages to the enemy. He turned him
back and from then on played a radio game which had them going in all
directions.”

That was another part of the legend, said Smiley: at Yelnya, thanks to Karla,
the Germans shelled their own forward line.

“And between these two sightings,” he continued, “in 1936 and 1941, Karla
visited Britain; we think he was here six months. But even today we don’t know
—that’s to say, I don’t know—under what name or cover. Which isn’t to say
Gerald doesn’t. But Gerald isn’t likely to tell us, at least not on purpose.”

Smiley had never talked to Guillam this way. He was not given to confidences
or long lectures; Guillam knew him as a shy man, for all his vanities, and one
who expected very little of communication.

“In ’48-odd, having served his country loyally, Karla did a spell in prison and

later in Siberia. There was nothing personal about it. He simply happened to be
in one of those sections of Red army intelligence which, in some purge or other,
ceased to exist.”

And certainly, Smiley went on, after his post-Stalin reinstatement, he went to
America; because when the Indian authorities in the summer of ’55 arrested him
in Delhi on vague immigration charges, he had just flown in from California.
Circus gossip later linked him with the big treason scandals in Britain and the
States.

Smiley knew better: “Karla was in disgrace again. Moscow was out for his
blood, and we thought we might persuade him to defect. That was why I flew to
Delhi. To have a chat with him.”

There was a pause while the weary boy slouched over and enquired whether
everything was to their satisfaction. Smiley, with great solicitude, assured him
that it was.

“The story of my meeting with Karla,” he resumed, “belonged very much to
the mood of the period. In the mid-fifties, Moscow Centre was in pieces on the
floor. Senior officers were being shot or purged wholesale and its lower ranks
were seized with a collective paranoia. As a first result, there was a crop of
defections among Centre officers stationed overseas. All over the place—
Singapore, Nairobi, Stockholm, Canberra, Washington, I don’t know where—we
got this same steady trickle from the residencies: not just the big fish, but the
legmen, drivers, cypher clerks, typists. Somehow we had to respond—I don’t
think it’s ever realised how much the industry stimulates its own inflation—and
in no time I became a kind of commercial traveller, flying off one day to a
capital city, the next to a dingy border outpost—once even to a ship at sea—to
sign up defecting Russians. To seed, to stream, to fix the terms, to attend to
debriefing and eventual disposal.”

Guillam was watching him all the while, but even in that cruel neon glow
Smiley’s expression revealed nothing but a slightly anxious concentration.

“We evolved, you might say, three kinds of contract for those whose stories
held together. If the client’s access wasn’t interesting, we might trade him to
another country and forget him. Buy him for stock, as you would say, much as
the scalp-hunters do today. Or we might play him back into Russia—that’s
assuming his defection had not already been noticed there. Or, if he was lucky,
we took him; cleaned him of whatever he knew and resettled him in the West.
London decided, usually. Not me. But remember this. At that time Karla—or
Gerstmann, as he called himself—was just another client. I’ve told his story back
to front; I didn’t want to be coy with you, but you have to bear in mind now,
through anything that happened between us—or didn’t happen, which is more to

the point—that all I or anyone in the Circus knew when I flew to Delhi was that
a man calling himself Gerstmann had been setting up a radio link between
Rudnev, head of illegal networks at Moscow Centre, and a Centre-run apparatus
in California that was lying fallow for want of a means of communication. That’s
all. Gerstmann had smuggled a transmitter across the Canadian border and lain
up for three weeks in San Francisco breaking in the new operator. That was the
assumption, and there was a batch of test transmissions to back it up.”

For these test transmissions between Moscow and California, Smiley
explained, a book code was used: “Then, one day, Moscow signalled a straight
order—”

“Still on the book code?”

“Precisely. That is the point. Owing to a temporary inattention on the part of
Rudnev’s cryptographers, we were ahead of the game. The wranglers broke the
code and that’s how we got our information. Gerstmann was to leave San
Francisco at once and head for Delhi for a rendezvous with the Tass
correspondent, a talent-spotter who had stumbled on a hot Chinese lead and
needed immediate direction. Why they dragged him all the way from San
Francisco to Delhi, why it had to be Karla and no one else—well, that’s a story
for another day. The only material point is that when Gerstmann kept the
rendezvous in Delhi, the Tass man handed him an aeroplane ticket and told him
to go straight home to Moscow. No questions. The order came from Rudnev
personally. It was signed with Rudnev’s workname and it was brusque even by
Russian standards.”

Whereupon the Tass man fled, leaving Gerstmann standing on the pavement
with a lot of questions and twenty-eight hours until take-off.

“He hadn’t been standing there long when the Indian authorities arrested him
at our request and carted him off to Delhi jail. As far as I remember, we had
promised the Indians a piece of the product. I think that was the deal,” he
remarked and, like someone suddenly shocked by the faultiness of his own
memory, fell silent and looked distractedly down the steamy room. “Or perhaps
we said they could have him when we’d done with him. Dear, oh dear.”

“It doesn’t really matter,” Guillam said.

“For once in Karla’s life, as I say, the Circus was ahead of him,” Smiley
resumed, having taken a sip of wine and made a face. “He couldn’t know it but
the San Francisco network which he had just serviced had been rolled up hide
and hair the day he left for Delhi. As soon as Control had the story from the
wranglers, he traded it to the Americans on the understanding that they missed
Gerstmann but hit the rest of the Rudnev network in California. Gerstmann flew
on to Delhi unaware, and he was still unaware when I arrived at Delhi jail to sell

him a piece of insurance, as Control called it. His choice was very simple. There
could not be the slightest doubt, on present form, that Gerstmann’s head was on
the block in Moscow, where to save his own neck Rudnev was busy denouncing
him for blowing the San Francisco network. The affair had made a great splash
in the States, and Moscow was very angry at the publicity. I had with me the
American press photographs of the arrest, even of the radio set Karla had
imported and the signal plans he had cached before he left. You know how
prickly we all become when things get into the papers.”

Guillam did; and with a jolt remembered the Testify file, which he had left
with Mendel earlier that evening.

“To sum it up, Karla was the proverbial cold-war orphan. He had left home to
do a job abroad. The job had blown up in his face, but he couldn’t go back: home
was more hostile than abroad. We had no powers of permanent arrest, so it was
up to Karla to ask us for protection. I don’t think I had ever come across a
clearer case for defection. I had only to convince him of the arrest of the San
Francisco network—wave the press photographs and cuttings from my briefcase
at him—talk to him a little about the unfriendly conspiracies of Brother Rudnev
in Moscow, and cable the somewhat overworked inquisitors in Sarratt, and with
any luck I’d make London by the weekend. I rather think I had tickets for
Sadler’s Wells. It was Ann’s great year for ballet.”

Yes, Guillam had heard about that, too: a twenty-year-old Welsh Apollo, the
season’s wonder boy. They had been burning up London for months.

The heat in the jail was appalling, Smiley continued. The cell had an iron table
at the centre and iron cattle rings let into the wall. “They brought him manacled,
which seemed silly because he was so slight. I asked them to free his hands and
when they did, he put them on the table in front of him and watched the blood
come back. It must have been painful but he didn’t comment on it. He’d been
there a week and he was wearing a calico tunic. Red. I forget what red meant.
Some piece of prison ethic.” Taking a sip of wine, he again pulled a face, then
slowly corrected the gesture as the memories once more bore in upon him.

“Well, at first sight, he made little impression on me. I would have been hard
put to it to recognise in the little fellow before me the master of cunning we have
heard about in Irina’s diary, poor woman. I suppose it’s also true that my nerve-
ends had been a good deal blunted by so many similar encounters in the last few
months, by travel, and well by—well, by things at home.”

In all the time Guillam had known him, it was the nearest Smiley had ever
come to acknowledging Ann’s infidelities.

“For some reason, it hurt an awful lot.” His eyes were still open but his gaze
had fixed upon an inner world. The skin of his brow and cheeks was drawn

smooth as if by the exertion of his memory; but nothing could conceal from
Guillam the loneliness evoked by this one admission. “I have a theory which I
suspect is rather immoral,” Smiley went on, more lightly. “Each of us has only a
quantum of compassion. That if we lavish our concern on every stray cat, we
never get to the centre of things. What do you think of it?”

“What did Karla look like?” Guillam asked, treating the question as rhetorical.

“Avuncular. Modest, and avuncular. He would have looked very well as a
priest: the shabby, gnomic variety one sees in small Italian towns. Little wiry
chap, with silvery hair and bright brown eyes and plenty of wrinkles. Or a
schoolmaster, he could have been a schoolmaster: tough—whatever that means
—and sagacious within the limits of his experience; but the small canvas, all the
same. He made no other initial impression, except that his gaze was straight and
it fixed on me from early in our talk. If you can call it a talk, seeing that he never
uttered a word. Not one, the whole time we were together; not a syllable. Also it
was stinking hot and I was travelled to death.”

Out of a sense of manners rather than appetite, Smiley set to work on his food,
eating several mouthfuls joylessly before resuming his narrative. “There,” he
muttered, “that shouldn’t offend the cook. The truth is, I was slightly
predisposed against Mr. Gerstmann. We all have our prejudices and radio men
are mine. They’re a thoroughly tiresome lot, in my experience, bad fieldmen and
overstrung, and disgracefully unreliable when it comes down to doing the job.
Gerstmann, it seemed to me, was just another of the clan. Perhaps I’m looking
for excuses for going to work on him with less”—he hesitated—“less care, less
caution, than in retrospect would seem appropriate.” He grew suddenly stronger.
“Though I’m not at all sure I need make any excuses,” he said.

Here Guillam sensed a wave of unusual anger, imparted by a ghostly smile
that crossed Smiley’s pale lips. “To hell with it,” Smiley muttered.

Guillam waited, mystified.

“I also remember thinking that prison seemed to have taken him over very fast
in seven days. He had that white dust in the skin and he wasn’t sweating. I was,
profusely. I trotted out my piece, as I had a dozen times that year already, except
that there was obviously no question of his being played back into Russia as our
agent. 'You have the alternative. It’s no one else’s business but your own. Gome
to the West and we can give you, within reason, a decent life. After questioning,
at which you are expected to cooperate, we can help you to a new start, a new
name, seclusion, a certain amount of money. On the other hand, you can go
home and I suppose they’ll shoot you or send you to a camp. Last month they
sent Bykov, Shur, and Muranov. Now why don’t you tell me your real name?’
Something like that. Then I sat back and wiped away the sweat and waited for

him to say, 'Yes, thank you.’ He did nothing. He didn’t speak. He simply sat
there stiff and tiny under the big fan that didn’t work, looking at me with his
brown, rather jolly eyes. Hands out in front of him. They were very calloused. I
remember thinking I must ask him where he had been doing so much manual
labour. He held them—like this—resting on the table, palms upward and fingers
a little bent, as if he were still manacled.”

The boy, thinking that by this gesture Smiley was indicating some want, came
lumbering over, and Smiley again assured him that all was doubly well, and the
wine in particular was exquisite—he really wondered where they had it from; till
the boy left grinning with secret amusement and flapped his cloth at an adjoining
table.

“It was then, I think, that an extraordinary feeling of unease began to creep
over me. The heat was really getting to me. The stench was terrible and I
remember listening to the pat-pat of my own sweat falling onto the iron table. It
wasn’t just his silence; his physical stillness began to get under my skin. Oh, I
had known defectors who took time to speak. It can be a great wrench for
somebody trained to secrecy even towards his closest friends suddenly to open
his mouth and spill secrets to his enemies. It also crossed my mind that the
prison authorities might have thought it a courtesy to soften him up before they
brought him to me. They assured me they hadn’t, but of course one can never
tell. So at first, I put his silence down to shock. But this stillness—this intense,
watchful stillness—was a different matter. Specially when everything inside me
was so much in motion: Ann, my own heartbeats, the effects of heat and travel..

“I can understand,” said Guillam quietly.

“Can you? Sitting is an eloquent business; any actor will tell you that. We sit
according to our natures. We sprawl and straddle, we rest like boxers between
rounds, we fidget, perch, cross and uncross our legs, lose patience, lose
endurance. Gerstmann did none of those things. His posture was finite and
irreducible, his little jagged body was like a promontory of rock; he could have
sat that way all day, without stirring a muscle. Whereas I—” Breaking out in an
awkward, embarrassed laugh, Smiley tasted the wine again, but it was no better
than before. “Whereas I longed to have something before me—papers, a book, a
report. I think I am a restless person, fussy, variable. I thought so then, anyway. I
felt I lacked philosophic repose. Lacked philosophy, if you like. My work had
been oppressing me much more than I realised; till now. But in that foul cell I
really felt aggrieved. I felt that the entire responsibility for fighting the cold war
had landed on my shoulders. Which was tripe, of course; I was just exhausted
and a little bit ill.” He drank again.

“I tell you,” he insisted, once more quite angry with himself. “No one has any
business to apologise for what I did.”

“What did you do?” Guillam asked, with a laugh.

“So anyway there came this gap,” Smiley resumed, disregarding the question.
“Hardly of Gerstmann’s making, since he was all gap; so of mine, then. I had
said my piece; I had flourished the photographs, which he ignored—I may say,
he appeared quite ready to take my word for it that the San Francisco network
was blown. I restated this part, that part, talked a few variations, and finally I
dried up. Or, rather, sat there sweating like a pig. Well, any fool knows that if
ever that happens, you get up and walk out. Take it or leave it,’ you say. 'See
you in the morning’; anything. 'Go away and think for an hour.’

“As it was, the next thing I knew, I was talking about Ann.” He left no time
for Guillam’s muffled exclamation. “Oh, not about my Ann, not in as many
words. About his Ann. I assumed he had one. I had asked myself—lazily, no
doubt—what would a man think of in such a situation, what would I? And my
mind came up with a subjective answer: his woman. Is it called 'projection’ or
'substitution’? I detest those terms but I’m sure one of them applies. I exchanged
my predicament for his, that is the point, and as I now realise I began to conduct
an interrogation with myself—he didn’t speak, can you imagine? There were
certain externals, it is true, to which I pinned the approach. He looked connubial;
he looked like half a union; he looked too complete to be alone in all his life.
Then there was his passport, describing Gerstmann as married; and it is a habit
in all of us to make our cover stories, our assumed personae, at least parallel
with the reality.” He lapsed again into a moment of reflection. “I often thought
that. I even put it to Gontrol: we should take the opposition’s cover stories more
seriously, I said. The more identities a man has, the more they express the person
they conceal. The fifty-year-old who knocks five years off his age. The married
man who calls himself a bachelor; the fatherless man who gives himself two
children ... Or the interrogator who projects himself into the life of a man who
does not speak. Few men can resist expressing their appetites when they are
making a fantasy about themselves.”

He was lost again, and Guillam waited patiently for him to come back. For
while Smiley might have fixed his concentration upon Karla, Guillam had fixed
his on Smiley; and just then would have gone anywhere with him, turned any
corner, in order to remain beside him and hear the story out.

“I also knew from the American observation reports that Gerstmann was a
chain-smoker: Gamels. I sent out for several packs of them—'packs’ is the
American word?—and I remember feeling very strange as I handed money to a

guard. I had the impression, you see, that Gerstmann saw something symbolic in
the transaction of money between myself and the Indian. I wore a money belt in
those days. I had to grope and peel off a note from a bundle. Gerstmann’s gaze
made me feel like a fifth-rate imperialist oppressor.” He smiled. “And that I
assuredly am not Bill, if you like. Percy. But not I.” He called to the boy, in
order to send him away: “May we have some water, please? A jug and two
glasses? Thank you.” Again he picked up the story: “So I asked him about Mrs.
Gerstmann. I asked him: where was she? It was a question I would dearly have
wished answered about Ann. No reply but the eyes unwavering. To either side of
him, the two guards, and their eyes seemed so light by comparison. She must
make a new life, I said; there was no other way. Had he no friend he could count
on to look after her? Perhaps we could find methods of getting in touch with her
secretly? I put it to him that his going back to Moscow would do nothing for her
at all. I was listening to myself, I ran on, I couldn’t stop. Perhaps I didn’t want
to. I was really thinking of leaving Ann, you see; I thought the time had come.

To go back would be a quixotic act, I told him, of no material value to his wife
or anyone—quite the reverse. She would be ostracised; at best, she would be
allowed to see him briefly before he was shot. On the other hand, if he threw in
his lot with us, we might be able to trade her; we had a lot of stock in those days,
remember, and some of it was going back to Russia as barter; though why in
God’s name we should have used it up for that purpose is beyond me. Surely, I
said, she would prefer to know him safe and well in the West, with a fair chance
that she herself would join him, than shot or starving to death in Siberia? I really
harped upon her: his expression encouraged me. I could have sworn I was
getting through to him, that I had found the chink in his armour; when of course
all I was doing—all I was doing was showing him the chink in mine. And when
I mentioned Siberia, I touched something. I could feel it, like a lump in my own
throat; I could feel in Gerstmann a shiver of revulsion. Well, naturally I did,”
Smiley commented sourly; “since it was only recently that he had been made an
inmate. Finally, back came the guard with the cigarettes, armfuls of them, and
dumped them with a clatter on the iron table. I counted the change, tipped him,
and in doing so again caught the expression in Gerstmann’s eyes; I fancied I read
amusement there, but really I was no longer in a state to tell. I noticed that the
boy refused my tip; I suppose he disliked the English. I tore open a packet and
offered Gerstmann a cigarette. 'Gome,’ I said, 'you’re a chain-smoker, everyone
knows that. And this is your favourite brand.’ My voice sounded strained and
silly, and there was nothing I could do about it. Gerstmann stood up and politely
indicated to the warders that he would like to return to his cell.”

Taking his time, Smiley pushed aside his half-eaten food, over which white

flakes of fat had formed like seasonable frost.

“As he left the cell, he changed his mind and helped himself to a packet of
cigarettes and the lighter from the table—my lighter, a gift from Ann. To
George from Ann with all my love.’ I would never have dreamed of letting him
take it in the ordinary way; but this was not the ordinary way. Indeed I thought it
thoroughly appropriate that he should take her lighter; I thought it—Lord help
me—expressive of the bond between us. He dropped the lighter and the
cigarettes into the pouch of his red tunic, then put out his hand for handcuffs. I
said, 'Light one now, if you want.’ I told the guards, 'Let him light a cigarette,
please.’ But he didn’t make a movement. 'The intention is to put you on
tomorrow’s plane to Moscow unless we come to terms,’ I added. He might not
have heard me. I watched the guards lead him out, then returned to my hotel;
someone drove me—to this day I couldn’t tell you who. I no longer knew what I
felt. I was more confused and more ill than I would admit, even to myself. I ate a
poor dinner, drank too much, and ran a soaring temperature. I lay on my bed
sweating, dreaming about Gerstmann. I wanted him terribly to stay. Lightheaded
as I was, I had really set myself to keep him, to remake his life—if possible to
set him up again with his wife in idyllic circumstances. To make him free; to get
him out of the war for good. I wanted him desperately not to go back.” He
glanced up with an expression of self-irony. “What I am saying, Peter, is it was
Smiley, not Gerstmann, who was stepping out of the conflict that night.”

“You were ill,” Guillam insisted.

“Let us say tired. Ill or tired; all night, between aspirin and quinine and treacly
visions of the Gerstmann marriage resurrected, I had a recurring image. It was of
Gerstmann, poised on the sill, staring down into the street with those fixed
brown eyes, and myself talking to him, on and on, 'Stay, don’t jump, stay.’ Not
realising, of course, that I was dreaming of my own insecurity, not his. In the
early morning a doctor gave me injections to bring down the fever. I should have
dropped the case, cabled for a replacement. I should have waited before going to
the prison, but I had nothing but Gerstmann in mind; I needed to hear his
decision. By eight o’clock I was already having myself escorted to the
accommodation cells. He was sitting stiff as a ramrod on a trestle bench; for the
first time, I guessed the soldier in him, and I knew that, like me, he hadn’t slept
all night. He hadn’t shaved and there was a silver down on his jaw which gave
him an old man’s face. On other benches Indians were sleeping, and with his red
tunic and this silvery colouring he looked very white among them. He was
holding Ann’s lighter in his hands; the packet of cigarettes lay beside him on the
bench, untouched. I concluded that he had been using the night, and the forsworn
cigarettes, to decide whether he could face prison and interrogation, and death.

One look at his expression told me that he had decided he could. I didn’t beseech
him,” Smiley said, going straight on. “He would never have been swayed by
histrionics. His plane left in the mid-morning; I still had two hours. I am the
worst advocate in the world, but in those two hours I tried to summon all the
reasons I knew for his not flying to Moscow. I believed, you see, that I had seen
something in his face that was superior to mere dogma, not realising that it was
my own reflection. I had convinced myself that Gerstmann ultimately was
accessible to ordinary human arguments coming from a man of his own age and
profession and—well, durability. I didn’t promise him wealth and women and
Cadillacs and cheap butter; I accepted that he had no use for those things. I had
the wit by then, at least, to steer clear of the topic of his wife. I didn’t make
speeches to him about freedom—whatever that means—or the essential goodwill
of the West; besides, they were not favourable days for selling that story, and I
was in no clear ideological state myself. I took the line of kinship. 'Look,’ I said,
'we’re getting to be old men, and we’ve spent our lives looking for the
weaknesses in one another’s systems. I can see through Eastern values just as
you can see through our Western ones. Both of us, I am sure, have experienced
ad nauseam the technical satisfactions of this wretched war. But now your own
side is going to shoot you. Don’t you think it’s time to recognise that there is as
little worth on your side as there is on mine? Look,’ I said, 'in our trade we have
only negative vision. In that sense, neither of us has anywhere to go. Both of us
when we were young subscribed to great visions—’ Again I felt an impulse in
him—Siberia—I had touched a nerve. 'But not any more. Surely?’ I urged him
just to answer me this: did it not occur to him that he and I by different routes
might well have reached the same conclusions about life? Even if my
conclusions were what he would call unliberated, surely our workings were
identical? Did he not believe, for example, that the political generality was
meaningless? That only the particular in life had value for him now? That in the
hands of politicians grand designs achieve nothing but new forms of the old
misery? And that therefore his life, the saving of it from yet another meaningless
firing squad, was more important—morally, ethically more important—than the
sense of duty, or obligation, or commitment, or whatever it was that kept him on
this present path of self-destruction? Did it not occur to him to question—after
all the travels of his life—to question the integrity of a system that proposed
cold-bloodedly to shoot him down for misdemeanours he had never committed?

I begged him—yes, I did beseech him. I’m afraid; we were on the way to the
airport and he still had not addressed a word to me—I begged him to consider
whether he really believed; whether faith in the system he had served was
honestly possible to him at this moment.”

For a while now, Smiley sat silent.

“I had thrown psychology to the winds, such as I possess; tradecraft, too. You
can imagine what Control said. My story amused him, all the same; he loved to
hear of people’s weakness. Mine especially, for some reason.” He had resumed
his factual manner. “So there we are. When the plane arrived, I climbed aboard
with him and flew part of the distance: in those days it wasn’t all jet. He was
slipping away from me and I couldn’t do anything to stop him. I’d given up
talking but I was there if he wanted to change his mind. He didn’t. He would
rather die than give me what I wanted; he would rather die than disown the
political system to which he was committed. The last I saw of him, so far as I
know, was his expressionless face framed in the cabin window of the aeroplane,
watching me walk down the gangway. A couple of very Russian-looking thugs
had joined us and were sitting in the seats behind him, and there was really no
point in my staying. I flew home, and Control said: 'Well, I hope to God they do
shoot him,’ and restored me with a cup of tea. That filthy China stuff he drinks,
lemon jasmine or whatever; he sends out for it to that grocer’s round the corner. I
mean he used to. Then he sent me on three months’ leave without the option. I
like you to have doubts,’ he said. Tt tells me where you stand. But don’t make a
cult of them or you’ll be a bore.’ It was a warning. I heeded it. And he told me to
stop thinking about the Americans so much; he assured me that he barely gave
them a thought.”

Guillam gazed at him, waiting for the resolution. “But what do you make of
it?” he demanded, in a tone that suggested he had been cheated of the end. “Did
Karla ever really think of staying?”

“I’m sure it never crossed his mind,” said Smiley with disgust. “I behaved like
a soft fool. The very archetype of a flabby Western liberal. But I would rather be
my kind of fool than his, for all that. I am sure,” he repeated vigorously, “that
neither my arguments nor his own predicament at Moscow Centre would
ultimately have swayed him in the least. I expect he spent the night working out
how he would outgun Rudnev when he got home. Rudnev was shot a month
later, incidentally. Karla got Rudnev’s job and set to work reactivating his old
agents. Among them Gerald, no doubt. It’s odd to reflect that all the time he was
looking at me, he could have been thinking of Gerald. I expect they’ve had a
good laugh about it since.”

The episode had one other result, said Smiley. Since his San Francisco
experience, Karla had never once touched illegal radio. He cut it right out of his
handwriting. “Embassy links are a different matter. But in the field his agents
aren’t allowed to go near it. And he still has Ann’s cigarette lighter.”

“Yours,” Guillam corrected him.

“Yes. Yes, mine. Of course. Tell me,” he continued, as the waiter took away
his money, “was Tarr referring to anyone in particular when he made that
unpleasant reference to Ann?”

“Tm afraid he was. Yes.”

“The rumour is as precise as that?” Smiley enquired. “And it goes that far
down the line? Even to Tarr?”

“Yes.”

“And what does it say, precisely?”

“That Bill Haydon was Ann Smiley’s lover,” said Guillam, feeling that
coldness coming over him which was his protection when he broke bad news
such as: you’re blown; you’re sacked; you’re dying.

“Ah. I see. Yes. Thank you.”

There was a very awkward silence.

“And was there—is there a Mrs. Gerstmann?” Guillam asked.

“Karla once made a marriage with a girl in Leningrad, a student. She killed
herself when he was sent to Siberia.”

“So Karla is fireproof,” Guillam asked finally. “He can’t be bought and he
can’t be beaten?”

They returned to the car.

“I must say that was rather expensive for what we had,” Smiley confessed.
“Do you think the waiter robbed me?”

But Guillam was not disposed to chat about the cost of bad meals in England.
Driving again, the day once more became a nightmare to him, a milling
confusion of half-perceived dangers, and suspicions.

“So who’s Source Merlin?” he demanded. “Where could Alleline have had
that information from, if not from the Russians themselves?”

“Oh, he had it from the Russians all right.”

“But for God’s sake, if the Russians sent Tarr—”

“They didn’t. Nor did Tarr use the British passports, did he? The Russians got
it wrong. What Alleline had was the proof that Tarr had fooled them. That is the
vital message we have learned from that whole storm in a teacup.”

“So what the hell did Percy mean about 'muddying pools’? He must have
been talking about Irina, for heaven’s sake.”

“And Gerald,” Smiley agreed.

Again they drove in silence, and the gap between them seemed suddenly
unbridgeable.

“Look, I’m not quite there myself, Peter,” Smiley said quietly. “But nearly I
am. Karla’s pulled the Gircus inside out; that much I understand, so do you. But
there’s a last clever knot, and I can’t undo it. Though I mean to. And if you want

a sermon, Karla is not fireproof, because he’s a fanatic. And one day, if I have
anything to do with it, that lack of moderation will be his downfall.”

It was raining as they reached Stratford tube station; a bunch of pedestrians
was huddled under the canopy.

“Peter, I want you to take it easy from now on.”

“Three months without the option?”

“Rest on your oars a bit.”

Closing the passenger door after him, Guillam had a sudden urge to wish
Smiley good night or even good luck, so he leaned across the seat and lowered
the window and drew in his breath to call. But Smiley was gone. He had never
known anyone who could disappear so quickly in a crowd.

Through the remainder of that same night, the light in the dormer window of Mr.
Barraclough’s attic room at the Islay Hotel burned uninterrupted. Unchanged,
unshaven, George Smiley remained bowed at the Major’s card table, reading,
comparing, annotating, cross-referring—all with an intensity that, had he been
his own observer, would surely have recalled for him the last days of Control on
the fifth floor at Cambridge Circus. Shaking the pieces, he consulted Guillam’s
leave rosters and sick-lists going back over the last year, and set these beside the
overt travel pattern of Cultural Attache Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, his
trips to Moscow, his trips out of London, as reported to the Foreign Office by
Special Branch and the immigration authorities. He compared these again with
the dates when Merlin apparently supplied his information and, without quite
knowing why he was doing it, broke down the Witchcraft reports into those
which were demonstrably topical at the time they were received and those which
could have been banked a month, two months before, either by Merlin or his
controllers, in order to bridge empty periods: such as think pieces, character
studies of prominent members of the administration, and scraps of Kremlin tittle-
tattle which could have been picked up any time and saved for a rainless day.
Having listed the topical reports, he set down their dates in a single column and
threw out the rest. At this point, his mood could be best compared with that of a
scientist who senses by instinct that he is on the brink of a discovery and is
awaiting any minute the logical connection. Later, in conversation with Mendel,
he called it “shoving everything into a test-tube and seeing if it exploded.” What
fascinated him most, he said, was the very point that Guillam had made
regarding Alleline’s grim warnings about muddied pools: he was looking, in
other terms, for the “last clever knot” that Karla had tied in order to explain
away the precise suspicions to which Irina’s diary had given shape.

He came up with some curious preliminary findings. First, that on the nine

occasions when Merlin had produced a topical report, either Polyakov had been
in London or Toby Esterhase had taken a quick trip abroad. Second, that over the
crucial period following Tarr’s adventure in Hong Kong this year, Polyakov was
in Moscow for urgent cultural consultations; and that soon afterwards Merlin
came through with some of his most spectacular and topical material on the
“ideological penetration” of the United States, including an appreciation of
Centre’s coverage of the major American intelligence targets.

Backtracking again, he established that the converse was also true: that the
reports he had discarded on the grounds that they had no close attachment to
recent events were those which most generally went into distribution while
Polyakov was in Moscow or on leave.

And then he had it.

No explosive revelation, no flash of light, no cry of “Eureka,” phone calls to
Guillam, Eacon, “Smiley is a world champion.” Merely that here before him, in
the records he had examined and the notes he had compiled, was the
corroboration of a theory which Smiley and Guillam and Ricki Tarr had that day
from their separate points of view seen demonstrated: that between the mole
Gerald and the Source Merlin there was an interplay which could no longer be
denied; that Merlin’s proverbial versatility allowed him to function as Karla’s
instrument as well as Alleline’s. Or should he rather say, Smiley reflected—
tossing a towel over his shoulder and hopping blithely into the corridor for a
celebratory bath—as Karla’s agent? And that at the heart of this plot lay a device
so simple that it left him genuinely elated by its symmetry. It had even a physical
presence: here in Eondon, a house, paid for by the Treasury, all sixty thousand
pounds of it; and often coveted, no doubt, by the many luckless tax-payers who
daily passed it by, confident they could never afford it and not knowing that they
had already paid for it.

It was with a lighter heart than he had known for many months that he took up
the stolen file on Operation Testify.

To her credit, Matron had been worried about Roach all week, ever since she
had spotted him alone in the washroom, ten minutes after the rest of his
dormitory had gone down to breakfast, still in his pyjama trousers, hunched over
a basin while he doggedly scrubbed his teeth. When she questioned him, he
avoided her eye. “It’s that wretched father of his,” she told Thursgood. “He’s
getting him down again.” And by the Friday: “You must write to the mother and
tell her he’s having a spell.”

But not even Matron, for all her motherly perception, would have hit on plain
terror as the diagnosis.

Whatever could he do—he, a child? That was his guilt. That was the threat
that led directly back to the misfortune of his parents. That was the predicament
that threw upon his hunched shoulders the responsibility night and day for
preserving the world’s peace. Roach, the watcher—“best watcher in the whole
damn unit,” to use Jim Prideaux’s treasured words—had finally watched too
well. He would have sacrificed everything he possessed—his money, his leather
photograph case of his parents, whatever gave him value in the world—if it
would buy him release from the knowledge that had consumed him since Sunday
evening.

He had put out signals. On Sunday night, an hour after lights out, he had gone
noisily to the lavatory, probed his throat, gagged, and finally vomited. But the
dormitory monitor, who was supposed to wake and raise the alarm—“Matron,
Roach’s been sick”—slept stubbornly through the whole charade. Roach
clambered miserably back to bed. From the call-box outside the staffroom next
afternoon, he had dialled the menu for the day and whispered strangely into the
mouthpiece, hoping to be overheard by a master and taken for mad. No one paid
him any attention. He had tried mixing up reality with dreams, in the hope that
the event would be converted into something he had imagined; but each morning
as he passed the Dip he saw again Jim’s crooked figure stooping over the spade
in the moonlight; he saw the black shadow of his face under the brim of his old
hat, and heard the grunt of effort as he dug.

Roach should never have been there. That also was his guilt: that the
knowledge was acquired by sin. After a cello lesson on the far side of the
village, he had returned to school with deliberate slowness in order to be too late
for evensong, and Mrs. Thursgood’s disapproving eye. The whole school was
worshipping, all but himself and Jim: he heard them sing the Te Deum as he

passed the church, taking the long route so that he could skirt the Dip, where
Jim’s light was glowing. Standing in his usual place. Roach watched Jim’s
shadow move slowly across the curtained window. He’s turning in early, he
decided with approval as the light suddenly went out; for Jim had recently been
too absent for his taste, driving off in the Alvis after rugger and not returning till
Roach was asleep. Then the trailer door opened and closed, and Jim was
standing at the vegetable patch with a spade in his hand and Roach in great
perplexity was wondering what on earth he should be wanting to dig for in the
dark. Vegetables for his supper? For a moment Jim stood very still, listening to
the Te Deum; then glared slowly round and straight at Roach, though he was out
of sight against the blackness of the hummocks. Roach even thought of calling to
him, but felt too sinful on account of missing chapel.

Finally Jim began measuring. That, at least, was how it seemed to Roach.
Instead of digging, he had knelt at one corner of the patch and laid the spade on
the earth, as if aligning it with something that was out of sight to Roach: for
instance, the church spire. This done, Jim strode quickly to where the blade lay,
marked the spot with a thud of his heel, took up the spade, and dug fast—Roach
counted twelve times—then stood back, taking stock again. From the church,
silence; then prayers. Quickly stooping, Jim drew a package from the ground,
which he at once smothered in the folds of his duffel coat. Seconds later, and
much faster than seemed possible, the trailer door slammed, the light went on
again, and in the boldest moment of his life Bill Roach tiptoed down the Dip to
within three feet of the poorly curtained window, using the slope to give himself
the height he needed to look in.

Jim stood at the table. On the bunk behind him lay a heap of exercise books, a
vodka bottle, and an empty glass. He must have dumped them there to make
space. He had a penknife ready but he wasn’t using it. Jim would never have cut
string if he could avoid it. The package was a foot long and made of yellowy
stuff like a tobacco pouch. Pulling it open, he drew out what seemed to be a
monkey wrench wrapped in sacking. But who would bury a monkey wrench,
even for the best car England ever made? The screws or bolts were in a separate
yellow envelope; he spilled them on to the table and examined each in turn. Not
screws: pen-tops. Not pen-tops, either; but they had sunk out of sight.

And not a monkey wrench, not a spanner—nothing, but absolutely nothing,
for the car.

Roach had blundered wildly to the brow. He was running between the
hummocks, making for the drive, but running slower than he had ever run
before; running through sand and deep water and dragging grass, gulping the
night air, sobbing it out again, running lopsidedly like Jim, pushing now with

this leg, now with the other, flailing with his head for extra speed. He had no
thought for where he was heading. All his awareness was behind him, fixed on
the black revolver and the bands of chamois leather; on the pen-tops that turned
to bullets as Jim threaded them methodically into the chamber, his lined face
tipped towards the lamplight, pale and slightly squinting in the dazzle.

“1 won’t be quoted, George,” the Minister warned, in his lounging drawl. “No
minutes, no pack-drill. I got voters to deal with. You don’t. Nor does Oliver
Lacon, do you, Oliver?”

He had also, thought Smiley, the American violence with auxiliary verbs.
“Yes, I’m sorry about that,” he said.

“You’d be sorrier still if you had my constituency,” the Minister retorted.

Predictably, the mere question of where they should meet had sparked a silly
quarrel. Smiley had pointed out to Lacon that it would be unwise to meet at his
room in Whitehall, since it was under constant attack by Circus personnel,
whether janitors delivering dispatch boxes or Percy Alleline dropping in to
discuss Ireland. Whereas the Minister declined both the Islay Hotel and Bywater
Street, on the arbitrary grounds that they were insecure. He had recently
appeared on television and was proud of being recognised. After several more
calls back and forth, they settled for Mendel’s semi-detached Tudor residence in
Mitcham, where the Minister and his shiny car stuck out like a sore thumb.

There they now sat, Lacon, Smiley, and the Minister, in the trim front room with
net curtains and fresh salmon sandwiches, while their host stood upstairs
watching the approaches. In the lane, children tried to make the chauffeur tell
them whom he worked for.

Behind the Minister’s head ran a row of books on bees. They were Mendel’s
passion, Smiley remembered: he used the word “exotic” for bees that did not
come from Surrey. The Minister was a young man still, with a dark jowl that
looked as though it had been knocked off-true in some unseemly fracas. His
head was bald on top, which gave him an unwarranted air of maturity, and a
terrible Eton drawl. “All right, so what are the decisions?” He also had the
bully’s art of dialogue.

“Well first, I suppose, you should damp down whatever recent negotiations
you’ve been having with the Americans. I was thinking of the untitled secret
annexe which you keep in your safe,” said Smiley, “the one that discusses the
further exploitation of Witchcraft material.”

“Never heard of it,” said the Minister.

“I quite understand the incentives, of course; it’s always tempting to get one’s
hands on the cream of that enormous American service, and I can see the
argument for trading them Witchcraft in return.”

“So what are the arguments against?” the Minister enquired as if he were

talking to his stockbroker.

“If the mole Gerald exists,” Smiley began. Of all her cousins, Ann had once
said proudly, only Miles Sercombe was without a single redeeming feature. For
the first time, Smiley really believed she was right. He felt not only idiotic but
incoherent. “If the mole exists, which I assume is common ground among us . .

.” He waited, but no one said it wasn’t. “If the mole exists,” he repeated, “it’s not
only the Circus that will double its profits by the American deal. Moscow Centre
will, too, because they’ll get from the mole whatever you buy from the
Americans.”

In a gesture of frustration, the Minister slapped his hand on Mendel’s table,
leaving a moist imprint on the polish.

“God damn it, I do not understand,” he declared. “That Witchcraft stuff is
bloody marvellous! A month ago it was buying us the moon. Now we’re
disappearing up our orifices and saying the Russians are cooking it for us. What
the hell’s happening?”

“Well, I don’t think that’s quite as illogical as it sounds, as a matter of fact.
After all, we’ve run the odd Russian network from time to time, and though I say
it myself we ran them rather well. We gave them the best material we could
afford. Rocketry, war planning. You were in on that yourself”—this to Lacon,
who threw a jerky nod of agreement. “We tossed them agents we could do
without; we gave them good communications, safed their courier links, cleared
the air for their signals so that we could listen to them. That was the price we
paid for running the opposition—what was your expression?—Tor knowing how
they briefed their commissars.’ I’m sure Karla would do as much for us if he was
running our networks. He’d do more, wouldn’t he, if he had his eye on the
American market, too?” He broke off and glanced at Lacon. “Much, much more.
An American connection—a big American dividend, I mean—would put the
mole Gerald right at the top table. The Gircus, too, by proxy of course. As a
Russian, one would give almost anything to the English if . . . well, if one could
buy the Americans in return.”

“Thank you,” said Lacon quickly.

The Minister left, taking a couple of sandwiches with him to eat in the car and
failing to say goodbye to Mendel, presumably because he was not a constituent.

Lacon stayed behind.

“You asked me to look out for anything on Prideaux,” he announced at last.
“Well, I find that we do have a few papers on him, after all.”

He had happened to be going through some files on the internal security of the
Gircus, he explained, “Simply to clear my decks.” Doing so, he had stumbled on
some old positive vetting reports. One of them related to Prideaux.

“He was cleared absolutely, you understand. Not a shadow. However”—an
odd inflexion of his voice caused Smiley to glance at him—“I think it might
interest you, all the same. Some tiny murmur about his time at Oxford. We’re all
entitled to be a bit pink at that age.”

“Indeed, yes.”

The silence returned, broken only by the soft tread of Mendel upstairs.

“Prideaux and Haydon were really very close indeed, you know,” Lacon
confessed. “I hadn’t realised.”

He was suddenly in a great hurry to leave. Delving in his briefcase, he hauled
out a large plain envelope, thrust it into Smiley’s hand, and went off to the
prouder world of Whitehall; and Mr. Barraclough to the Islay Hotel, where he
returned to his reading of Operation Testify.

26

It was lunchtime next day. Smiley had read and slept a little, read again and
bathed, and as he climbed the steps to that pretty London house he felt pleased,
because he liked Sam.

The house was brown brick and Georgian, just off Grosvenor Square. There
were five steps and a brass doorbell in a scalloped recess. The door was black,
with pillars either side. He pushed the bell and he might as well have pushed the
door; it opened at once. He entered a circular hallway with another door the
other end, and two large men in black suits who might have been ushers at
Westminster Abbey. Over a marble chimney-piece, horses pranced and they
might have been Stubbs. One man stood close while he took off his coat; the
second led him to a Bible desk to sign the book.

“Hebden,” Smiley murmured as he wrote, giving a workname Sam could
remember.

“Adrian Hebden.”

The man who had his coat repeated the name into a house telephone:

“Mr. Hebden—Mr. Adrian Hebden.”

“if you wouldn’t mind waiting one second, sir,” said the man by the Bible
desk. There was no music, and Smiley had the feeling there should have been;
also a fountain.

“I’m a friend of Mr. Gollins’s, as a matter of fact,” said Smiley, “if Mr. Gollins
is available. 1 think he may even be expecting me.”

The man at the telephone murmured, “Thank you,” and hung it on the hook.
He led Smiley to the inner door and pushed it open, it made no sound at all, not
even a rustle on the silk carpet.

“Mr. Gollins is over there, sir,” he murmured respectfully. “Drinks are with the
courtesy of the house.”

The three reception rooms had been run together, with pillars and arches to
divide them optically, and mahogany panelling, in each room was one table, the
third was sixty feet away. The lights shone on meaningless pictures of fruit in
colossal gold frames, and on the green baize tablecloths. The curtains were
drawn, the tables about one third occupied, four or five players to each, all men,
but the only sounds were the click of the ball in the wheel, the click of the chips
as they were redistributed, and the very low murmur of the croupiers.

“Adrian Hebden,” said Sam Gollins, with a twinkle in his voice. “Long time
no see.”

“Hullo, Sam,” said Smiley, and they shook hands.

“Come down to my lair,” said Sam, and nodded to the only other man in the
room who was standing, a very big man with blood pressure and a chipped face.
The big man nodded, too.

“Care for it?” Sam enquired as they crossed a corridor draped in red silk.

“It’s very impressive,” said Smiley politely.

“That’s the word,” said Sam. “Impressive. That’s what it is.” He was wearing
a dinner jacket. His office was done in Edwardian plush, his desk had a marble
top and ball-and-claw feet, but the room itself was very small and not at all well
ventilated—more like the back room of a theatre, Smiley thought, furnished with
leftover props.

“They might even let me put in a few pennies of my own later, give it another
year. They’re toughish boys, but very go-ahead, you know.”

“I’m sure,” said Smiley.

“Like we were in the old days.”

“That’s right.”

He was trim and lighthearted in his manner and he had a trim black
moustache. Smiley couldn’t imagine him without it. He was probably fifty. He
had spent a lot of time out East, where they had once worked together on a
catch-and-carry job against a Chinese radio operator. His complexion and hair
were greying but he still looked thirty-five. His smile was warm and he had a
confiding, messroom friendliness. He kept both hands on the table as if he were
at cards, and he looked at Smiley with a possessive fondness that was paternal or
filial or both.

“If chummy goes over five,” he said, still smiling, “give me a buzz, Harry,
will you? Otherwise keep your big mouth shut; I’m chatting up an oil king.” He
was talking into a box on his desk. “Where is he now?”

“Three up,” said a gravel voice. Smiley guessed it belonged to the chipped
man with blood pressure.

“Then he’s got eight to lose,” said Sam blandly. “Keep him at the table, that’s
all. Make a hero of him.” He switched off and grinned. Smiley grinned back.

“Really, it’s a great life,” Sam assured him. “Better than selling washing
machines, anyway. Bit odd, of course, putting on the dinner jacket at ten in the
morning. Reminds one of diplomatic cover.” Smiley laughed. “Straight, too,
believe it or not,” Sam added with no change to his expression. “We get all the
help we need from the arithmetic.”

“I’m sure you do,” said Smiley, once more with great politeness.

“Care for some music?”

It was canned and came out of the ceiling. Sam turned it up as loud as they

could bear.

“So what can I do you for?” Sam asked, the smile broadening.

“I want to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was shot. You were duty
officer.”

Sam smoked brown cigarettes that smelt of cigar. Lighting one, he let the end
catch fire, then watched it die to an ember. “Writing your memoirs, old boy?” he
enquired.

“We’re reopening the case.”

“What’s this we, old boy?”

“I, myself, and me, with Lacon pushing and the Minister pulling.”

“All power corrupts but some must govern, and in that case Brother Lacon
will reluctantly scramble to the top of the heap.”

“It hasn’t changed,” said Smiley.

Sam drew ruminatively on his cigarette. The music switched to phrases of
Noel Coward.

“It’s a dream of mine, actually,” said Sam Collins through the smoke. “One of
these days Percy Alleline walks through that door with a shabby brown suitcase
and asks for a flutter. He puts the whole of the secret vote on red and loses.”

“The record’s been filleted,” said Smiley. “It’s a matter of going to people and
asking what they remember. There’s almost nothing on file at all.”

“I’m not surprised,” said Sam. Over the phone he ordered sandwiches. “Live
on them,” he explained. “Sandwiches and canapes. One of the perks.”

He was pouring coffee when the red pinlight glowed between them on the
desk.

“Chummy’s even,” said the gravel voice.

“Then start counting,” said Sam, and closed the switch.

He told it plainly but precisely, the way a good soldier recalls a battle, not to
win or lose any more, but simply to remember. He had just come back from
abroad, he said; a three-year stint in Vientiane. He’d checked in with personnel
and cleared himself with the Dolphin; no one seemed to have any plans for him,
so he was thinking of taking off for the South of France for a month’s leave
when MacFadean, that old janitor who was practically Control’s valet, scooped
him up in the corridor and marched him to Control’s room.

“This was which day, exactly?” said Smiley.

“October 19th.”

“The Thursday.”

“The Thursday. I was thinking of flying to Nice on Monday. You were in
Berlin. I wanted to buy you a drink but the mothers said you were occupe, and
when I checked with Movements they told me you’d gone to Berlin.”

“Yes, that’s true,” Smiley said simply. “Control sent me there.”

To get me out of the way, he might have added; it was a feeling he had had
even at the time.

“I hunted round for Bill but Bill was also in baulk. Control had packed him
up-country somewhere,” said Sam, avoiding Smiley’s eye.

“On a wild goose chase,” Smiley murmured. “But he came back.”

Here Sam tipped a sharp, quizzical glance in Smiley’s direction, but he added
nothing on the subject of Bill Haydon’s journey.

“The whole place seemed dead. Damn nearly caught the first plane back to
Vientiane.”

“It pretty much was dead,” Smiley confessed, and thought. Except for
Witchcraft.

And Control, said Sam, looked as though he’d had a five-day fever. He was
surrounded by a sea of files, his skin was yellow, and as he talked he kept
breaking off to wipe his forehead with a handkerchief. He scarcely bothered with
the usual fan-dance at all, said Sam. He didn’t congratulate him on three good
years in the field, or make some snide reference to his private life, which was at
that time messy; he simply said he wanted Sam to do weekend duty instead of
Mary Masterman; could Sam swing it?

“ 'Sure I can swing it,’ I said. Tf you want me to do duty officer. I’ll do it.’ He
said he’d give me the rest of the story on Saturday. Meanwhile I must tell no
one. I mustn’t give a hint anywhere in the building, even that he’d asked me this
one thing. He needed someone good to man the switchboard in case there was a
crisis, but it had to be someone from an outstation or someone like me who’d
been away from head office for a long time. And it had to be an old hand.”

So Sam went to Mary Masterman and sold her a hard-luck story about not
being able to get the tenant out of his flat before he went on leave on Monday;
how would it be if he did her duty for her and saved himself the hotel? He took
over at nine on Saturday morning with his toothbrush and six cans of beer in a
briefcase, which still had palm-tree stickers on the side. Geoff Agate was slated
to relieve him on Sunday evening.

Once again Sam dwelt on how dead the place was. Back in the old days,
Saturdays were much like any other day, he said. Most regional sections had a
deskman working weekends, some even had night staff, and when you took a
tour of the building you had the feeling that, warts and all, this was an outfit that
had a lot going. But that Saturday morning the building might have been
evacuated, said Sam; which in a way, from what he heard later, it had been—on
orders from Control. A couple of wranglers toiled on the second floor; the radio
and code rooms were going strong, but those boys worked all the hours anyway.

Otherwise, said Sam, it was the big silence. He sat around waiting for Control to
ring but nothing happened. He fleshed out another hour teasing the janitors,
whom he reckoned the idlest lot of so-and-so’s in the Circus. He checked their
attendance lists and found two typists and one desk officer marked in but absent,
so he put the head janitor, a new boy called Mellows, on report. Finally he went
upstairs to see if Control was in.

“He was sitting all alone, except for MacFadean. No mothers, no you—^just
old Mac peeking around with jasmine tea and sympathy. Too much?”

“No, just go on, please. As much detail as you can remember.”

“So then Control peeled off another veil. Half a veil. Someone was doing a
special job for him, he said. It was of great importance to the service. He kept
saying that: to the service. Not Whitehall or sterling or the price of fish, but us.
Even when it was all over, I must never breathe a word about it. Not even to you.
Or Bill or Bland or anyone.”

“Nor Alleline?”

“He never mentioned Percy once.”

“No,” Smiley agreed. “He scarcely could at the end.”

“I should regard him, for the night, as Director of Operations. I should see
myself as cut-out between Control and whatever was going on in the rest of the
building. If anything came in—a signal, a phone call, however trivial it seemed
—I should wait till the coast was clear, then whip upstairs and hand it to Control.
No one was to know, now or later, that Control was the man behind the gun. In
no case should I phone him or minute him; even the internal lines were taboo.
Truth, George,” said Sam, helping himself to a sandwich.

“Oh, I do believe you,” said Smiley with feeling.

If outgoing telegrams had to be sent, Sam should once more act as Control’s
cut-out. He need not expect much to happen till this evening; even then it was
most unlikely anything would happen. As to the janitors and people like that, as
Control put it, Sam should do his damnedest to act natural and look busy.

The seance over, Sam returned to the duty room, sent out for an evening
paper, opened a can of beer, selected an outside telephone line, and set about
losing his shirt. There was steeplechasing at Kempton, which he hadn’t watched
for years. Early evening, he took another walk around the lines and tested the
alarm pads on the floor of the general registry. Three out of fifteen didn’t work,
and by this time the janitors were really loving him. He cooked himself an egg,
and when he’d eaten it he trotted upstairs to take a pound off old Mac and give
him a beer.

“He’d asked me to put him a quid on some nag with three left feet. I chatted
with him for ten minutes, went back to my post, wrote some letters, watched a

rotten movie on the telly, then turned in. The first call came just as I was getting
to sleep. Eleven-twenty, exactly. The phones didn’t stop ringing for the next ten
hours. I thought the switchboard was going to blow up in my face.”

“Arcadi’s five down,” said a voice over the box.

“Excuse me,” said Sam, with his habitual grin and, leaving Smiley to the
music, slipped upstairs to cope.

Sitting alone, Smiley watched Sam’s brown cigarette slowly burning away in
the ashtray. He waited, Sam didn’t return, and he wondered whether he should
stub it out. Not allowed to smoke on duty, he thought; house rules.

“All done,” said Sam.

The first call came from the Foreign Office resident clerk on the direct line, said
Sam. In the Whitehall stakes, you might say, the Foreign Office won by a curled
lip.

“The Reuters headman in London had just called him with a story of a
shooting in Prague. A British spy had been shot dead by Russian security forces,
there was a hunt out for his accomplices, and was the F.O. interested? The duty
clerk was passing it to us for information. I said it sounded bunkum, and rang off
just as Mike Meakin, of wranglers, came through to say that all hell had broken
out on the Czech air: half of it was coded, but the other half was en clair. He kept
getting garbled accounts of a shooting near Brno. Prague or Brno? I asked. Or
both? Just Brno. I said keep listening, and by then all five buzzers were going.
Just as I was leaving the room, the resident clerk came back on the direct. The
Reuters man had corrected his story, he said: for Prague read Brno. I closed the
door and it was like leaving a wasps’ nest in your drawing-room. Control was
standing at his desk as I came in. He’d heard me coming up the stairs. Has
Alleline put a carpet on those stairs, by the way?”

“No,” said Smiley. He was quite impassive. “George is like a swift,” Ann had
once told Haydon in his hearing. “He cuts down his body temperature till it’s the
same as the environment. Then he doesn’t lose energy adjusting.”

“You know how quick he was when he looked at you. He checked my hands
to see whether I had a telegram for him, and I wished I’d been carrying
something but they were empty. T’m afraid there’s a bit of a panic,’ I said. I gave
him the gist, he looked at his watch; I suppose he was trying to work out what
should have been happening if everything had been plain sailing. I said, 'Can I
have a brief, please?’ He sat down; I couldn’t see him too well—he had that low
green light on his desk. I said again, T’ll need a brief. Do you want me to deny
it? Why don’t I get someone in?’ No answer. Mind you, there wasn’t anyone to
get, but I didn’t know that yet. T must have a brief.’ We could hear footsteps

downstairs and I knew the radio boys were trying to find me. 'Do you want to
come down and handle it yourself?’ I said. I went round to the other side of the
desk, stepping over these files, all open at different places; you’d think he was
compiling an encyclopaedia. Some of them must have been pre-war. He was
sitting like this.”

Sam bunched the fingers of one hand, put the tips to his forehead, and stared
at the desk. His other hand was laid flat, holding Control’s imaginary fob watch.
“Tell MacFadean to get me a cab, then find Smiley.’ 'What about the
operation?’ I asked. I had to wait all night for an answer. 'It’s deniable,’ he says.
'Both men had foreign documents. No one could know they were British at this
stage.’ 'They’re only talking about one man,’ I said. Then I said, 'Smiley’s in
Berlin.’ That’s what I think I said, anyway. So we have another two-minute
silence. 'Anyone will do. It makes no difference.’ I should have been sorry for
him, I suppose, but just then I couldn’t raise much sympathy. I was having to
hold the baby and I didn’t know a damn thing. MacFadean wasn’t around so I
reckoned Control could find his own cab, and by the time I got to the bottom of
the steps I must have looked like Gordon at Khartoum. The duty harridan from
monitoring was waving bulletins at me like flags, a couple of janitors were
yelling at me, the radio boy was clutching a bunch of signals, the phones were
going—not just my own, but half a dozen of the direct lines on the fourth floor. I
went straight to the duty room and switched off all the lines while I tried to get
my bearings. The monitor—what’s that woman’s name, for God’s sake, used to
play bridge with the Dolphin?”

“Purcell. Molly Purcell.”

“That’s the one. Her story was at least straightforward. Prague radio was
promising an emergency bulletin in half an hour’s time. That was quarter of an
hour ago. The bulletin would concern an act of gross provocation by a Western
power, an infringement of Czechoslovakia’s sovereignty, and an outrage against
freedom-loving people of all nations. Apart from that,” said Sam dryly, “it was
going to be laughs all the way. I rang Bywater Street, of course; then I made a
signal to Berlin telling them to find you and fly you back by yesterday. I gave
Mellows the main phone numbers and sent him off to find an outside line and get
hold of whoever was around of the top brass. Percy was in Scotland for the
weekend and out to dinner. His cook gave Mellows a number; he rang it, spoke
to his host. Percy had just left.”

“I’m sorry,” Smiley interrupted. “Rang Bywater Street, what for?” He was
holding his upper lip between his finger and thumb, pulling it out like a
deformity, while he stared into the middle distance.

“In case you’d come back early from Berlin,” said Sam.

“And had I?”

“ No.”

“So who did you speak to?”

“Ann.”

Smiley said, “Ann’s away just now. Could you remind me how it went, that
conversation?”

“I asked for you and she said you were in Berlin.”

“And that was all?”

“It was a crisis, George,” Sam said, in a warning tone.

“So?”

“I asked her whether by any chance she knew where Bill Haydon was. It was
urgent. I gathered he was on leave but might be around. Somebody once told me
they were cousins.” He added: “Besides, he’s a friend of the family, I
understood.”

“Yes. He is. What did she say?”

“Gave me a shirty ‘no’ and rang off. Sorry about that, George. War’s war.”

“How did she sound?” Smiley asked, after letting the aphorism lie between
them for some while.

“I told you: shirty.”

Roy Bland was at Leeds University talent-spotting, said Sam, and not
available.

Between calls, Sam was getting the whole book thrown at him. He might as
well have invaded Cuba. The military were yelling about Czech tank movements
along the Austrian border; the wranglers couldn’t hear themselves think for the
radio traffic round Brno; and as for the Foreign Office, the resident clerk was
having the vapours and yellow fever all in one. “First Lacon, then the Minister
were baying at the doors, and at half past twelve we had the promised Czech
news bulletin, twenty minutes late but none the worse for that. A British spy
named Jim Ellis, travelling on false Czech papers and assisted by Czech counter¬
revolutionaries, had attempted to kidnap an unnamed Czech general in the
forests near Brno and smuggle him over the Austrian border. Ellis had been shot
but they didn’t say killed; other arrests were imminent. I looked Ellis up in the
workname index and found Jim Prideaux. And I thought, just as Control must
have thought. If Jim is shot and has Czech papers, how the hell do they know his
workname, and how do they know he’s British? Then Bill Haydon arrived, white
as a sheet. Picked up the story on the ticker-tape at his club. He turned straight
round and came to the Circus.”

“At what time was that, exactly?” Smiley asked, with a vague frown. “It must
have been rather late.”

Sam looked as if he wished he could make it easier. “One-fifteen,” he said.

“Which is late, isn’t it, for reading club ticker-tapes.”

“Not my world, old boy.”

“Bill’s the Savile, isn’t he?”

“Don’t know,” said Sam doggedly. He drank some coffee. “He was a treat to
watch, that’s all I can tell you. I used to think of him as an erratic sort of devil.
Not that night, believe me. All right, he was shaken. Who wouldn’t be? He
arrived knowing there’d been a God-awful shooting party and that was about all.
But when I told him that it was Jim who’d been shot, he looked at me like a
madman. Thought he was going to go for me. 'Shot. Shot how? Shot dead?’ I
shoved the bulletins into his hand and he tore through them one by one—”

“Wouldn’t he have known already from the ticker-tape?” Smiley asked, in a
small voice. “I thought the news was everywhere by then: Ellis shot. That was
the lead story, wasn’t it?”

“Depends which news bulletin he saw, I suppose,” Sam shrugged it off.
“Anyway, he took over the switchboard and by morning he’d picked up what
few pieces there were and introduced something pretty close to calm. He told the
Foreign Office to sit tight and hold its water; he got hold of Toby Esterhase and
sent him off to pull in a brace of Czech agents, students at the London School of
Economics. Bill had been letting them hatch till then; he was planning to turn
them round and play them back into Czecho. Toby’s lamplighters sandbagged
the pair of them and locked them up in Sarratt. Then Bill rang the Czech head
resident in London and spoke to him like a sergeant major: threatened to strip
him so bare he’d be the laughing-stock of the profession if a hair of Jim
Prideaux’s head was hurt. He invited him to pass that on to his masters. I felt I
was watching a street accident and Bill was the only doctor. He rang a press
contact and told him in strict confidence that Ellis was a Czech mercenary with
an American contract; he could use the story unattributably. It actually made the
late editions. Soon as he could, he slid off to Jim’s rooms to make sure he’d left
nothing around that a journalist might pick on if a journalist were clever enough
to make the connection, Ellis to Prideaux. I guess he did a thorough cleaning-up
job. Dependents, everything.”

“There weren’t any dependents,” Smiley said. “Apart from Bill, I suppose,” he
added, half under his breath.

Sam wound it up: “At eight o’clock Percy Alleline arrived; he’d cadged a
special plane off the Air Force. He was grinning all over. I didn’t think that was
very clever of him, considering Bill’s feelings, but there you are. He wanted to
know why I was doing duty, so I gave him the same story I’d given to Mary
Masterman: no flat. He used my phone to make a date with the Minister, and was

still talking when Roy Bland came in, hopping mad and half plastered, wanting
to know who the hell had been messing on his patch and practically accusing
me. I said, 'Christ, man, what about old Jim? You could pity him while you were
about it,’ but Roy’s a hungry boy and likes the living better than the dead. I gave
him the switchboard with my love, went down to the Savoy for breakfast, and
read the Sundays. The most any of them did was run the Prague radio reports
and a pooh-pooh denial from the Foreign Office.”

Finally Smiley said, “After that you went to the South of France?”

“For two lovely months.”

“Did anyone question you again—about Control, for instance?”

“Not till I got back. You were out on your ear by then; Control was ill in
hospital.” Sam’s voice deepened a little. “He didn’t do anything silly, did he?”

“He just died. What happened?”

“Percy was acting head boy. He called for me and wanted to know why I’d
done duty for Masterman and what communication I’d had with Control. I stuck
to my story and Percy called me a liar.”

“So that’s what they sacked you for: lying?”

“Alcoholism. The janitors got a bit of their own back. They’d counted five
beer cans in the waste-basket in the duty officer’s lair and reported it to the
housekeepers. There’s a standing order: no booze on the premises. In the due
process of time, a disciplinary body found me guilty of setting fire to the
Queen’s dockyards so I joined the bookies. What happened to you?”

“Oh, much the same. I didn’t seem to be able to convince them I wasn’t
involved.”

“Well, if you want anyone’s throat cut,” said Sam as he saw him quietly out
through a side door into a pretty mews, “give me a buzz.” Smiley was sunk in
thought. “And if you ever want a flutter,” Sam went on, “bring along some of
Ann’s smart friends.”

“Sam, listen. Bill was making love to Ann that night. No, listen. You phoned
her, she told you Bill wasn’t there. As soon as she’d rung off, she pushed Bill out
of bed and he turned up at the Circus an hour later knowing that there had been a
shooting in Czecho. If you were giving me the story from the shoulder—on a
postcard—that’s what you’d say?”

“Broadly.”

“But you didn’t tell Ann about Czecho when you phoned her—”

“He stopped at his club on the way to the Circus.”

“If it was open. Very well: then why didn’t he know that Jim Prideaux had
been shot?”

In the daylight, Sam looked briefly old, though the grin had not left his face.

He seemed about to say something, then changed his mind. He seemed angry,
then thwarted, then blank again. “Cheeribye,” he said. “Mind how you go,” and
withdrew to the permanent night-time of his elected trade.

27

When Smiley had left the Islay for Grosvenor Square that morning, the streets
had been bathed in harsh sunshine and the sky was blue. Now as he drove the
hired Rover past the unlovable faq:ades of the Edgware Road, the wind had
dropped, the sky was black with waiting rain, and all that remained of the sun
was a lingering redness on the tarmac. He parked in St. John’s Wood Road, in
the forecourt of a new tower block with a glass porch, but he did not enter by the
porch. Passing a large sculpture describing, as it seemed to him, nothing but a
sort of cosmic muddle, he made his way through icy drizzle to a descending
outside staircase marked “Exit Only.” The first flight was of terrazzo tile and had
a bannister of African teak. Below that, the contractor’s generosity ceased.
Rough-rendered plaster replaced the earlier luxury and a stench of uncollected
refuse crammed the air. His manner was cautious rather than furtive, but when
he reached the iron door he paused before putting both hands to the long handle
and drew himself together as if for an ordeal. The door opened a foot and
stopped with a thud, to be answered by a shout of fury, which echoed many
times like a shout in a swimming pool.

“Hey, why you don’t look out once?”

Smiley edged through the gap. The door had stopped against the bumper of a
very shiny car, but Smiley wasn’t looking at the car. Across the garage two men
in overalls were hosing down a Rolls-Royce in a cage. Both were looking in his
direction.

“Why you don’t come other way?” the same angry voice demanded. “You
tenant here? Why you don’t use tenant lift? This stair for fire.”

It was not possible to tell which of them was speaking, but whichever it was,
he spoke in a heavy Slav accent. The light in the cage was behind them. The
shorter man held the hose.

Smiley walked forward, taking care to keep his hands clear of his pockets.

The man with the hose went back to work, but the taller stayed watching him
through the gloom. He wore white overalls and he had turned the collar-points
upwards, which gave him a rakish air. His black hair was swept back and full.

“I’m not a tenant. I’m afraid,” Smiley conceded. “But I wonder if I might just
speak to someone about renting a space. My name’s Carmichael, ” he explained,
in a louder voice. “I’ve bought a flat up the road.”

He made a gesture as if to produce a card, as if his documents would speak
better for him than his insignificant appearance. “I’ll pay in advance,” he

promised. “I could sign a contract or whatever is necessary, I’m sure. I’d want it
to be above-board, naturally. I can give references, pay a deposit, anything
within reason. As long as it’s above-board. It’s a Rover. A new one. I won’t go
behind the company’s back, because I don’t believe in it. But I’ll do anything
else within reason. I’d have brought it down, but I didn’t want to presume. And
—well, I know it sounds silly but I didn’t like the look of the ramp. It’s so new,
you see.”

Throughout this protracted statement of intent, which he delivered with an air
of fussy concern, Smiley had remained in the downbeam of a bright light strung
from the rafter: a supplicant, rather abject figure, one might have thought, and
easily visible across the open space. The attitude had its effect. Leaving the cage,
the white figure strode towards a glazed kiosk, built between two iron pillars,
and with his fine head beckoned Smiley to follow. As he went, he pulled the
gloves off his hands. They were leather gloves, hand-stitched and quite
expensive.

“Well, you want mind out how you open door,” he warned in the same loud
voice. “You want use lift, see, or maybe you pay couple pounds. Use lift you
don’t make no trouble.”

“Max, I want to talk to you,” said Smiley once they were inside the kiosk.
“Alone. Away from here.”

Max was broad and powerful with a pale boy’s face, but the skin of it was
lined like an old man’s. He was handsome and his brown eyes were very still. He
had altogether a rather deadly stillness.

“Now? You want talk now?”

“In the car. I’ve got one outside. If you walk to the top of the ramp, you can
get straight into it.”

Putting his hand to his mouth. Max yelled across the garage. He was half a
head taller than Smiley and had a roar like a drum major’s. Smiley couldn’t
catch the words. Possibly they were Czech. There was no answer, but Max was
already unbuttoning his overall.

“It’s about Jim Prideaux,” Smiley said.

“Sure,” said Max.

They drove up to Hampstead and sat in the shiny Rover, watching the kids
breaking the ice on the pond. Real rain had held off, after all; perhaps because it
was so cold.

Above ground Max wore a blue suit and a blue shirt. His tie was blue but
carefully differentiated from the other blues: he had taken a lot of trouble to get
the shade. He wore several rings and flying boots with zips at the side.

“Fm not in it any more. Did they tell you?” Smiley asked. Max shrugged. “I
thought they would have told you,” Smiley said.

Max was sitting straight; he didn’t use the seat to lean on; he was too proud.
He did not look at Smiley. His eyes were turned fixedly to the pool and the kids
fooling and skidding in the reeds.

“They don’t tell me nothing,” he said.

“I was sacked,” said Smiley. “I guess at about the same time as you.”

Max seemed to stretch slightly, then settle again. “Too bad, George. What you
do, steal money?”

“I don’t want them to know. Max.”

“You private—I private, too,” said Max, and from a gold case offered Smiley
a cigarette, which he declined.

“I want to hear what happened,” Smiley went on. “I wanted to find out before
they sacked me but there wasn’t time.”

“That why they sack you?”

“Maybe.”

“You don’t know so much, huh?” said Max, his gaze nonchalantly on the kids.

Smiley spoke very simply, watching all the while in case Max didn’t
understand. They could have spoken German but Max wouldn’t have that, he
knew. So he spoke English and watched Max’s face.

“I don’t know anything. Max. I had no part in it at all. I was in Berlin when it
happened; I knew nothing of the planning or the background. They cabled me,
but when I arrived in London it was too late.”

“Planning,” Max repeated. “That was some planning.” His jaw and cheeks
became suddenly a mass of lines and his eyes turned narrow, making a grimace
or a smile. “So now you got plenty time, eh, George? Jesus, that was some
planning.”

“Jim had a special job to do. He asked for you.”

“Sure. Jim ask for Max to baby-sit.”

“How did he get you? Did he turn up in Acton and speak to Toby Esterhase,
and say, Toby, I want Max’? How did he get you?”

Max’s hands were resting on his knees. They were groomed and slender—all
but the knuckles, which were very broad. Now, at the mention of Esterhase, he
turned the palms slightly inwards and made a light cage of them as if he had
caught a butterfly.

“What the hell?” Max asked.

“So what did happen?”

“Was private,” said Max. “Jim private, I private. Like now.”

“Gome,” said Smiley. “Please.”

Max spoke as if it were any mess: family or business or love. It was a Monday
evening in mid-October—yes, the sixteenth. It was a slack time, he hadn’t been
abroad for weeks, and he was fed up. He had spent all day making a
reconnaissance of a house in Bloomsbury where a pair of Chinese students was
supposed to live; the lamplighters were thinking of mounting a burglary against
their rooms. He was on the point of returning to the Laundry in Acton to write
his report when Jim picked him up in the street with a chance-encounter routine
and drove him up to Crystal Palace, where they sat in the car and talked, like
now, except they spoke Czech. Jim said there was a special job going, something
so big, so secret that no one else in the Circus, not even Toby Esterhase, was
allowed to know that it was taking place. It came from the very top of the tree
and it was hairy. Was Max interested?

“I say, 'Sure, Jim. Max interested.’ Then he ask me: 'Take leave. You go to
Toby, you say, Toby, my mother sick, I got to take some leave.’ I don’t got no
mother. 'Sure,’ I say, 'I take leave. How long for, please, Jim?”’

The whole job shouldn’t last more than the weekend, said Jim. They should be
in on Saturday and out on Sunday. Then he asked Max whether he had any
current identities running for him: best would be Austrian, small trade, with
driving licence to match. If Max had none handy at Acton, Jim would get
something put together in Brixton.

“ 'Sure,’ I say. 'I have Hartmann, Rudi, from Linz, Sudeten emigre.’ ”

So Max gave Toby a story about girl trouble up in Bradford and Toby gave
Max a ten-minute lecture on the sexual mores of the English; and on the
Thursday, Jim and Max met in a safe house that the scalp-hunters ran in those
days, a rackety old place in Lambeth. Jim had brought the keys. A three-day hit,
Jim repeated; a clandestine conference outside Brno. Jim had a big map and they
studied it. Jim would travel Czech, Max would go Austrian. They would make
their separate ways as far as Brno. Jim would fly from Paris to Prague, then train
from Prague. He didn’t say what papers he would be carrying himself, but Max
presumed Czech because Czech was Jim’s other side; Max had seen him use it
before. Max was Hartmann Rudi, trading in glass and ovenware. He was to cross
the Austrian border by van near Mikulov, then head north to Brno, giving
himself plenty of time to make a six-thirty rendezvous on Saturday evening in a
side street near the football ground. There was a big match that evening starting
at seven. Jim would walk with the crowd as far as the side street, then climb into
the van. They agreed times, fallbacks, and the usual contingencies; and besides,
said Max, they knew each other’s handwriting by heart.

Once out of Brno, they were to drive together along the Bilovice road as far as
Krtiny, then turn east towards Racice. Somewhere along the Racice road they

would pass on the left side a parked black car, most likely a Fiat. The first two
figures of the registration would be 99. The driver would be reading a
newspaper. They would pull up; Max would go over and ask whether he was all
right. The man would reply that his doctor had forbidden him to drive more than
three hours at a stretch. Max would say it was true that long journeys were a
strain on the heart. The driver would then show them where to park the van and
take them to the rendezvous in his own car.

“Who were you meeting, Max? Did Jim tell you that as well?”

No, that was all Jim told him.

As far as Brno, said Max, things went pretty much as planned. Driving from
Mikulov, he was followed for a while by a couple of civilian motorcyclists who
interchanged every ten minutes, but he put that down to his Austrian number
plates and it didn’t bother him. He made Brno comfortably by mid-afternoon,
and to keep things shipshape he booked into the hotel and drank a couple of
coffees in the restaurant. Some stooge picked him up and Max talked to him
about the vicissitudes of the glass trade and about his girl in Linz who’d gone off
with an American. Jim missed the first rendezvous but he made the fallback an
hour later. Max supposed at first the train was late, but Jim just said, “Drive
slowly,” and he knew then that there was trouble.

This was how it was going to work, said Jim. There’d been a change of plan.
Max was to stay right out of it. He should drop Jim short of the rendezvous, then
lie up in Brno till Monday morning. He was not to make contact with any of the
Circus’s trade routes: no one from Aggravate, no one from Plato, least of all with
the Prague residency. If Jim didn’t surface at the hotel by eight on Monday
morning. Max should get out any way he could. If Jim did surface. Max’s job
would be to carry Jim’s message to Control: the message could be very simple; it
might be no more than one word. When he got to London, he should go to
Control personally, make an appointment through old MacFadean, and give him
the message—was that clear? If Jim didn’t show up. Max should take up life
where he left off and deny everything, inside the Circus as well as out.

“Did Jim say why the plan had changed?”

“Jim worried.”

“So something had happened to him on his way to meet you?”

“Maybe. I say Jim: 'Listen, Jim, I come with. You worried, I be baby-sitter. I
drive for you, shoot for you, what the hell?’ Jim get damn angry, okay?”

“Okay,” said Smiley.

They drove to the Racice road and found the car parked without lights facing a
track over a field, a Fiat, 99 on the number plates, black. Max stopped the van
and let Jim out. As Jim walked towards the Fiat, the driver opened the door an

inch in order to work the courtesy light. He had a newspaper opened over the
steering wheel.

“Could you see his face?”

“Was in shadow.”

Max waited; presumably they exchanged word codes, Jim got in, and the car
drove away over the track, still without lights. Max returned to Brno. He was
sitting over a schnapps in the restaurant when the whole town started rumbling.
He thought at first the sound came from the football stadium; then he realised it
was lorries, a convoy racing down the road. He asked the waitress what was
going on, and she said there had been a shooting in the woods—counter¬
revolutionaries were responsible. He went out to the van, turned on the radio,
and caught the bulletin from Prague. That was the first he had heard of a general.
He guessed there were cordons everywhere, and anyway he had Jim’s
instructions to lie up in the hotel till Monday morning.

“Maybe Jim send me message. Maybe some guy from resistance come to me.”

“With this one word,” said Smiley quietly.

“Sure.”

“He didn’t say what sort of word it was?”

“You crazy,” said Max. It was either a statement or a question.

“A Czech word or an English word or a German word?”

No one came, said Max, not bothering to answer craziness.

On Monday he burned his entry passport, changed the plates on his van, and
used his West German escape. Rather than head south he drove south west,
ditched the van, and crossed the border by bus to Freistadt, which was the softest
route he knew. In Freistadt he had a drink and spent the night with a girl because
he felt puzzled and angry and he needed to catch his breath. He got to Fondon on
Tuesday night, and despite Jim’s orders he thought he’d better try and contact
Control. “That was quite damn difficult,” he commented.

He tried to telephone but only got as far as the mothers. MacFadean wasn’t
around. He thought of writing but he remembered Jim, and how no one else in
the Circus was allowed to know. He decided that writing was too dangerous. The
rumour at the Acton Faundry said that Control was ill. He tried to find out what
hospital, but couldn’t.

“Did people at the Faundry seem to know where you’d been?”

“I wonder.”

He was still wondering when the housekeepers sent for him and asked to look
at his Rudi Hartmann passport. Max said he had lost it, which was after all pretty
near true. Why hadn’t he reported the loss? He didn’t know. When had the loss
occurred? He didn’t know. When did he last see Jim Prideaux? He couldn’t

remember. He was sent down to the Nursery at Sarratt but Max felt fit and angry,
and after two or three days the inquisitors got tired of him or somebody called
them off.

“I go back Acton Laundry; Toby Esterhase give me hundred pound, tell me go
to hell.”

A scream of applause went up round the pond. Two boys had sunk a great slab
of ice and now the water was bubbling through the hole.

“Max, what happened to Jim?”

“What the hell?”

“You hear these things. It gets around among the emigres. What happened to
him? Who mended him, how did Bill Haydon buy him back?”

“Emigres don’t speak Max no more.”

“But you have heard, haven’t you?”

This time it was the white hands that told him. Smiley saw the spread of
fingers, five on one hand, four on the other and already he felt the sickness
before Max spoke.

“So they shoot Jim from behind. Maybe Jim was running away, what the hell?
They put Jim in prison. That’s not so good for Jim. For my friends also. Not
good.” He started counting: “Pribyl,” he began, touching his thumb. “Bukova
Mirek, from Pribyl’s wife the brother,” he took a finger. “Also PribyTs wife,” a
second finger. A third: “Kolin Jiri. Also his sister, mainly dead. This was
network Aggravate.” He changed hands. “After network Aggravate come
network Plato. Come lawyer Rapotin, come Colonel Landkron, and typists Eva
Krieglova and Hanka Bilova. Also mainly dead. That’s damn big price,

George”—holding the clean fingers close to Smiley’s face—“that’s damn big
price for one Englishman with bullet-hole.” He was losing his temper. “Why you
bother, George? Circus don’t be no good for Czecho. Allies don’t be no good for
Czecho. No rich guy don’t get no poor guy out of prison! You want know some
history? How you say ‘Mdrchen, ’ please, George?”

“Fairy tale,” said Smiley.

“Okay, so don’t tell me no more damn fairy tale how English got to save
Czecho no more!”

“Perhaps it wasn’t Jim,” said Smiley after a long silence. “Perhaps it was
someone else who blew the networks. Not Jim.”

Max was already opening the door. “What the hell?” he asked.

“Max,” said Smiley.

“Don’t worry, George. I don’t got no one to sell you to. Okay?”

“Okay.”

Sitting in the car still, Smiley watched him hail a taxi. He did it with a flick of

the hand, as if he were summoning a waiter. He gave the address without
bothering to look at the driver. Then rode off sitting very upright again, staring
straight ahead of him, like royalty ignoring the crowd.

As the taxi disappeared. Inspector Mendel rose slowly from a bench, folded
together his newspaper, walked over to the Rover.

“You’re clean,” he said. “Nothing on your back, nothing on your conscience.”

Not so sure of that, Smiley handed him the keys to the car, then walked to the
bus stop, first crossing the road in order to head west.

28

His destination was in Fleet Street, a ground-floor cellar full of wine barrels. In
other areas, three-thirty might be considered a little late for a pre-luncheon
aperitif, but as Smiley gently pushed open the door a dozen shadowy figures
turned to eye him from the bar. And at a corner table, as unremarked as the
plastic prison arches or the fake muskets on the wall, sat Jerry Westerby with a
very large pink gin.

“Old boy,” said Jerry Westerby shyly, in a voice that seemed to come out of
the ground. “Well, I’ll be damned. Hey, Jimmy!” His hand, which he laid on
Smiley’s arm while he signalled for refreshment with the other, was enormous
and cushioned with muscle, for Jerry had once been wicketkeeper for a county
cricket team. In contrast to other wicketkeepers he was a big man, but his
shoulders were still hunched from keeping his hands low. He had a mop of sandy
grey hair and a red face and he wore a famous sporting tie over a cream silk
shirt. The sight of Smiley clearly gave him great joy, for he was beaming with
pleasure.

“Well, I’ll be damned,” he repeated. “Of all the amazing things. Hey, what are
you doing these days,” dragging him forcibly into the seat beside him. “Sunning
your fanny, spitting at the ceiling? Hey”—a most urgent question—“what’ll it
be?”

Smiley ordered a Bloody Mary.

“It isn’t complete coincidence, Jerry,” Smiley confessed. There was a slight
pause between them, which Jerry was suddenly concerned to fill.

“Listen, how’s the demon wife? All well? That’s the stuff.One of the great
marriages, that one—always said so.”

Jerry Westerby himself had made several marriages but few that had given
him pleasure.

“Do a deal with you, George,” he proposed, rolling one great shoulder towards
him. “I’ll shack up with Ann and spit at the ceiling, you take my job and write
up the women’s Ping-Pong. How’s that? God bless.”

“Gheers,” said Smiley good-humouredly.

“Haven’t seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact,” Jerry
confessed awkwardly with an unaccountable blush. “Ghristmas card from old
Toby last year, that’s about my lot. Guess they’ve put me on the shelf as well.
Gan’t blame them.” He flicked the rim of his glass. “Too much of this stuff,
that’s what it is. They think I’ll blab. Grack up.”

“Fm sure they don’t,” said Smiley, and the silence reclaimed them both.

“Too much firewater not good for braves,” Jerry intoned solemnly. For years
they had had this Red Indian joke running, Smiley remembered with a sinking
heart.

“How, ” said Smiley.

“How, ” said Jerry, and they drank.

“I burnt your letter as soon as I’d read it,” Smiley went on in a quiet,
unbothered voice. “In case you wondered. I didn’t tell anyone about it at all. It
came too late, anyway. It was all over.”

At this, Jerry’s lively complexion turned a deep scarlet.

“So it wasn’t the letter you wrote me that put them off you,” Smiley continued
in the same very gentle voice, “if that’s what you were thinking. And, after all,
you did drop it in to me by hand.”

“Very decent of you,” Jerry muttered. “Thanks. Shouldn’t have written it.
Talking out of school.”

“Nonsense,” said Smiley as he ordered two more. “You did it for the good of
the service.”

To himself, saying this, Smiley sounded like Lacon. But the only way to talk
to Jerry was to talk like Jerry’s newspaper: short sentences; facile opinions.

Jerry expelled some breath and a lot of cigarette smoke. “Last job—oh, year
ago,” he recalled with a new airiness. “More. Dumping some little packet in
Budapest. Nothing to it, really. Phone box. Ledge at the top. Put my hand up.

Left it there. Kid’s play. Don’t think I muffed it or anything. Did my sums first—
all that. Safety signals. 'Box ready for emptying. Help yourself.’ The way they
taught us, you know. Still, you lads know best, don’t you? You’re the owls. Do
one’s bit, that’s the thing. Can’t do more. All part of a pattern. Design.”

“They’ll be beating the doors down for you soon,” said Smiley consolingly. “I
expect they’re resting you up for a season. They do that, you know.”

“Hope so,” said Jerry with a loyal, very diffident smile. His glass shook
slightly as he drank.

“Was that the trip you made just before you wrote to me?” Smiley asked.

“Sure. Same trip, actually; Budapest, then Prague.”

“And it was in Prague that you heard this story? The story you referred to in
your letter to me?”

At the bar a florid man in a black suit was predicting the imminent collapse of
the nation. He gave it three months, he said, then curtains.

“Rum chap, Toby Esterhase,” said Jerry.

“But good,” said Smiley.

“Oh, my God, old boy, first rate. Brilliant, my view. But rum, you know.

How. ” They drank again, and Jerry Westerby loosely poked a finger behind his
head, in imitation of an Apache feather.

“Trouble is,” the florid man at the bar was saying over the top of his drink,

“we won’t even know it’s happened.”

They decided to lunch straight away, because Jerry had a story to file for
tomorrow’s edition about some top footballer who’d been caught shoplifting.
They went to a curry house where the management was content to serve beer at
teatime, and they agreed that if anyone bumped into them Jerry would introduce
George as his bank manager, a notion that tickled him repeatedly throughout his
hearty meal. There was background music, which Jerry called the connubial
flight of the mosquito, and at times it threatened to drown the fainter notes of his
husky voice. Which was probably just as well, for while Smiley made a brave
show of enthusiasm for the curry, Jerry was launched, after his initial reluctance,
upon quite a different story, concerning one Jim Ellis: the story that dear old
Toby Esterhase had refused to let him print.

Jerry Westerby was that extremely rare person, the perfect witness. He had no
fantasy, no malice, no personal opinion. Merely, the thing was rum. He couldn’t
get it off his mind and, come to think of it, he hadn’t spoken to Toby since.

“Just this card, you see, 'Happy Christmas, Toby’—picture of Leadenhall
Street in the snow.” He gazed in great perplexity at the electric fan. “Nothing
special about Eeadenhall Street, is there, old boy? Not a spy-house or a meeting
place or something, is it?”

“Not that I know of,” said Smiley, with a laugh.

“Couldn’t think why he chose Leadenhall Street for a Christmas card.

Damned odd, don’t you think?”

Perhaps he just wanted a snowy picture of London, Smiley suggested; Toby,
after all, was quite foreign in lots of ways.

“Rum way to keep in touch, I must say. Used to send me a crate of Scotch
regular as clockwork.” Jerry frowned and drank from his krug. “It’s not the
Scotch I mind,” he explained with that puzzlement that often clouded the greater
visions of his life; “buy my own Scotch any time. It’s just that when you’re on
the outside, you think everything has a meaning, so presents are important—see
what I’m getting at?”

It was a year ago—well, December. The Restaurant Sport in Prague, said Jerry
Westerby, was a bit off the track of your average Western journalist. Most of
them hung around the Cosmo or the International, talking in low murmurs and
keeping together because they were jumpy. But Jerry’s local was the Sport, and
ever since he had taken Holotek, the goalie, along after the winning match

against the Tartars, Jerry had had the big hand from the barman, whose name
was Stanislaus or Stan.

“Stan’s a perfect prince. Does just what he damn well pleases. Makes you
suddenly think Czecho’s a free country.”

Restaurant, he explained, meant bar. Whereas bar in Czecho meant nightclub,
which was rum. Smiley agreed that it must be confusing.

All the same, Jerry always kept an ear to the ground when he went there; after
all, it was Czecho, and once or twice he’d been able to bring back the odd
snippet for Toby or put him onto the track of someone.

“Even if it was just currency-dealing, black-market stuff. All grist to the mill,
according to Tobe. These little scraps add up—that’s what Tobe said, anyway.”

Quite right, Smiley agreed. That was the way it worked.

“Tobe was the owl, what?”

“Sure.”

“I used to work straight to Roy Bland, you see. Then Roy got kicked upstairs,
so Tobe took me over. Bit unsettling, actually, changes. Cheers.”

“How long had you been working to Toby when this trip took place?”

“Couple of years, not more.”

There was a pause while food came and krugs were refilled and Jerry
Westerby with his enormous hands shattered a popadam onto the hottest curry on
the menu, then spread a crimson sauce over the top. The sauce, he said, was to
give it bite. “Old Khan runs it up for me specially,” he explained, aside. “Keeps
it in a deep shelter.”

So anyway, he resumed, that night in Stan’s bar there was this young boy with
the pudding-bowl haircut and the pretty girl on his arm.

“And I thought. Watch out, Jerry, boy; that’s an army haircut. Right?”

“Right,” Smiley echoed, thinking that in some ways Jerry was a bit of an owl
himself.

It turned out the boy was Stan’s nephew, and very proud of his English.
“Amazing what people will tell you if it gives them a chance of showing off their
languages.” He was on leave from the army and he’d fallen in love with this girl;
he’d eight days to go and the whole world was his friend, Jerry included. Jerry
particularly, in fact, because Jerry was paying for the booze.

“So we’re all sitting hugger-mugger at the big table in the corner—students,
pretty girls, all sorts. Old Stan had come round from behind the bar and some
laddie was doing a fair job with a squeeze-box. Bags of Gemiltlichkeit, bags of
booze, bags of noise.”

The noise was specially important, Jerry explained, because it let him chat to
the boy without anyone else paying attention. The boy was sitting next to Jerry;

he’d taken a shine to him from the start. He had one arm slung round the girl and
one arm round Jerry.

“One of those kids who can touch you without giving you the creeps. Don’t
like being touched, as a rule. Greeks do it. Hate it, personally.”

Smiley said he hated it, too.

“Come to think of it, the girl looked a bit like Ann,” Jerry reflected. “Foxy—
know what I mean? Garbo eyes, lots of oomph.”

So while everyone was carrying on, singing and drinking and playing kiss-in-
the-ring, this lad asked Jerry whether he would like to know the truth about Jim
Ellis.

“Pretended I’d never heard of him,” Jerry explained to Smiley. “ 'Love to,’ I
said. 'Who’s Jim Ellis when he’s at home?’ And the boy looks at me as if I’m
daft and says, 'A British spy.’ Only no one else heard, you see; they were all
yelling and singing saucy songs. He had the girl’s head on his shoulder, but she
was half cut and in her seventh heaven, so he just went on talking to me, proud
of his English, you see.”

“I get it,” said Smiley.

“ 'British spy.’ Yells straight into my ear-hole. 'Fought with Czech partisans in
the war. Came here calling himself Hajek and was shot by the Russian secret
police.’ So I just shrugged and said, 'News to me, old boy.’ Not pushing, you
see. Mustn’t be pushy, ever. Scares them off.”

“You’re absolutely right,” said Smiley wholeheartedly, and for an interlude
patiently parried further questions about Ann, and what it was like to love—
really to love—the other person all your life.

“I am a conscript,” the boy began, according to Jerry Westerby. “I have to serve
in the army or I can’t go to university.” In October he had been on basic-training
manoeuvres in the forests near Brno. There was always a lot of military in the
woods there; in summer the whole area was closed to the public for a month at a
time. He was on a boring infantry exercise that was supposed to last two weeks,
but on the third day it was called off for no reason and the troops were ordered
back to town. That was the order: pack now and get back to barracks. The whole
forest was to be cleared by dusk.

“Within hours, every sort of daft rumour was flying around,” Jerry went on.
“Some fellow said the ballistics research station at Tisnov had blown up.
Somebody else said the training battalions had mutinied and were shooting up
the Russian soldiers. Fresh uprising in Prague, Russians taken over the
government, the Germans had attacked—God knows what hadn’t happened. You
know what soldiers are. Same everywhere, soldiers. Gossip till the cows come

home.”

The reference to the army moved Jerry Westerby to ask after certain
acquaintances from his military days, people Smiley had dimly known, and
forgotten. Finally they resumed.

“They broke camp, packed the lorries, and sat about waiting for the convoy to
get moving. They’d gone half a mile when everything stopped again and the
convoy was ordered off the road. Lorries had to duckshuffle into the trees. Got
stuck in the mud, ditches, every damn thing. Chaos, apparently.”

It was the Russians, said Westerby. They were coming from the direction of
Brno, and they were in a very big hurry and everything that was Czech had to
get out of the light or take the consequences.

“First came a bunch of motorcycles tearing down the track with lights flashing
and the drivers screaming at them. Then a staff car and civilians—the boy
reckoned six civilians altogether. Then two lorryloads of special troops armed to
the eyebrows and wearing combat paint. Finally a truck full of tracker dogs. All
making a most God-awful row. Not boring you am I, old boy?”

Westerby dabbed the sweat from his face with a handkerchief and blinked like
someone coming round. The sweat had come through his silk shirt as well; he
looked as if he had been under a shower. Curry not being a food he cared for,
Smiley ordered two more krugs to wash away the taste.

“So that was the first part of the story. Czech troops out, Russian troops in.

Got it?”

Smiley said yes, he thought he had his mind round it so far.

Back in Brno, however, the boy quickly learned that his unit’s part in the
proceedings was nowhere near done. Their convoy was joined up with another,
and the next night for eight or ten hours they tore round the countryside with no
apparent destination. They drove west to Trebic, stopped and waited while the
signals section made a long transmission; then they cut back south east nearly as
far as Znojmo on the Austrian border, signalling like mad as they went. No one
knew who had ordered the route; no one would explain a thing. At one point
they were ordered to fix bayonets; at another they pitched camp, then packed up
all their kit again and pushed off. Here and there they met up with other units:
near Breclav marshalling-yards, tanks going round in circles, once a pair of self-
propelled guns on pre-laid track. Everywhere the story was the same: chaotic,
pointless activity. The older hands said it was a Russian punishment for being
Czech. Back in Brno again, the boy heard a different explanation. The Russians
were after a British spy called Hajek. He’d been spying on the research station
and tried to kidnap a general and the Russians had shot him.

“So the boy asked, you see,” said Jerry. “Sassy little devil asked his sergeant.

'If Hajek is already shot, why do we have to tear round the countryside creating
an uproar?’ And the sergeant told him, 'Because it’s the army.’ Sergeants all over
the world, what?”

Very quietly Smiley asked, “We’re talking about two nights, Jerry. Which
night did the Russians move into the forest?”

Jerry Westerby screwed up his face in perplexity. “That’s what the boy wanted
to tell me, you see, George. That’s what he was trying to put over in Stan’s bar.
What all the rumours were about. The Russians moved in on Friday. They didn’t
shoot Hajek till Saturday. So the wise lads were saying: there you are, Russians
were waiting for Hajek to turn up. Knew he was coming. Knew the lot. Lay in
wait. Bad story, you see. Bad for our reputation—see what I mean? Bad for big
chief. Bad for tribe. How. ”

“How, ” said Smiley, into his beer.

“That’s what Toby felt, too, mind. We saw it the same way; we just reacted
differently.”

“So you told all to Toby,” said Smiley lightly, as he passed Jerry a large dish
of dal. “You had to see him anyway to tell him you’d dropped the package for
him in Budapest, so you told him the Hajek story, too.”

Well, that was just it, said Jerry. That was the thing that had bothered him, the
thing that was rum, the thing that made him write to George, actually. “Old Tobe
said it was tripe. Got all regimental and nasty. First he was keen as mustard,
clapping me on the back, and Westerby for mayor. He went back to the shop, and
next morning he threw the book at me. Emergency meeting, drove me round and
round the park in a car, yelling blue murder. Said I was so plastered these days I
didn’t know fact from fiction. All that stuff. Made me a bit shirty, actually.”

“I expect you wondered who he’d been talking to in between,” said Smiley
sympathetically. “What did he say exactly, ” he asked, not in any intense way but
as if he just wanted to get it all crystal clear in his mind.

“Told me it was most likely a put-up ploy. Boy was a provocateur. Disruption
job to make the Gircus chase its own tail. Tore my ears off for disseminating
half-baked rumours. I said to him, George: 'Old boy,’ I said. 'Tobe, I was only
reporting, old boy. No need to get hot under the collar. Yesterday you thought I
was the cat’s whiskers. No point in turning round and shooting the messenger. If
you’ve decided you don’t like the story, that’s your business.’ Wouldn’t sort of
listen any more—know what I mean? Illogical, I thought it was. Bloke like that.
Hot one minute and cold the next. Not his best performance—know what I
mean?”

With his left hand Jerry rubbed the side of his head, like a schoolboy
pretending to think. “ 'Okie-dokie,’ I said, 'forget it. I’ll write it up for the rag.

Not the part about the Russians getting there first. The other part. “Dirty work in
the forest,” that sort of tripe.’ I said to him, Tf it isn’t good enough for the
Circus, it’ll do for the rag.’ Then he went up the wall again. Next day some owl
rings the old man. Keep that baboon Westerby off the Ellis story. Rub his nose in
the D notice: formal warning. 'All further references to Jim Ellis alias Hajek
against the national interest, so put ’em on the spike.’ Back to women’s Ping-
Pong. Cheers.”

“But by then you’d written to me,” Smiley reminded him.

Jerry Westerby blushed terribly. “Sorry about that,” he said. “Got all
xenophobe and suspicious. Comes from being on the outside: you don’t trust
your best friends. Trust them—well, less than strangers.” He tried again: “Just
that I thought old Tobe was going a bit haywire. Shouldn’t have done it, should
I? Against the rules.” Through his embarrassment he managed a painful grin.
“Then I heard on the grapevine that the firm had given you the heave-ho, so I
felt an even bigger damn fool. Not hunting alone, are you, old boy? Not...” He
left the question unasked; but not, perhaps, unanswered.

As they parted, Smiley took him gently by the arm.

“If Toby should get in touch with you, I think it better if you don’t tell him we
met today. He’s a good fellow but he does tend to think people are ganging up on
him.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it, old boy.”

“And if he does get in touch in the next few days,” Smiley went on—in that
remote contingency, his tone suggested—“you could even warn me, actually.
Then I can back you up. Don’t ring me, come to think of it, ring this number.”

Suddenly Jerry Westerby was in a hurry; that story about the shoplifting
footballer couldn’t wait. But as he accepted Smiley’s card he did ask with a
queer, embarrassed glance away from him, “Nothing untoward going on is there,
old boy? No dirty work at the crossroads?” The grin was quite terrible. “Tribe
hasn’t gone on the rampage or anything?”

Smiley laughed and lightly laid a hand on Jerry’s enormous, slightly hunched
shoulder.

“Any time,” said Westerby.

“I’ll remember.”

“I thought it was you, you see: you who telephoned the old man.”

“It wasn’t.”

“Maybe it was Alleline.”

“I expect so.”

“Any time,” said Westerby again. “Sorry, you know. Love to Ann.” He
hesitated.

“Come on, Jerry, out with it,” said Smiley.

“Toby had some bad story about her and Bill the Brain. I told him to stuff it up
his shirt-front. Nothing to it, is there?”

“Thanks, Jerry. So long. How. ”

“I knew there wasn’t,” said Jerry, very pleased, and lifting his finger to denote
the feather, padded off into his own reserves.

29

Waiting that night, alone in bed at the Islay but not yet able to sleep, Smiley
once more took up the file that Lacon had given him in Mendel’s house. It dated
from the late fifties, when the Circus, like other Whitehall departments, was
being pressed by the competition to take a hard look at the loyalty of its staff.
Most of the entries were routine: telephone intercepts, surveillance reports,
endless interviews with dons, friends, and nominated referees. But one document
held Smiley like a magnet; he could not get enough of it. It was a letter, entered
baldly on the index as “Haydon to Fanshawe, February 3, 1937.” More precisely
it was a handwritten letter, from the undergraduate Bill Haydon to his tutor
Fanshawe, a Circus talent-spotter, introducing the young Jim Prideaux as a
suitable candidate for recruitment to British intelligence. It was prefaced by a
wry explication de texte. The Optimates were “an upper-class Christ Church
Club, mainly old Etonian,” wrote the unknown author. Fanshawe (P.R. de T.
Fanshawe, Legion d’Honneur, O.B.E., Personal File so-and-so) was its founder;
Haydon (countless cross-references) was in that year its leading light. The
political complexion of the Optimates, to whom Haydon’s father had also in his
day belonged, was unashamedly conservative. Fanshawe, now long dead, was a
passionate Empire man and “the Optimates were his private selection tank for
The Great Game,” ran the preface. Curiously enough, Smiley dimly remembered
Fanshawe from his own day: a thin eager man with rimless spectacles, a Neville
Chamberlain umbrella, and an unnatural flush to his cheeks as if he were still
teething. Steed-Asprey called him the fairy godfather.

“My dear Fan, I suggest you stir yourself to make a few enquiries about the
young gentleman whose name is appended on the attached fragment of human
skin.” [Inquisitors’ superfluous note: Prideaux] “You probably know Jim—if you
know him at all—as an athleticus of some accomplishment. What you do not
know but ought to is that he is no mean linguist nor yet a total idiot either ...”
[Here followed a biographical summary of surprising accuracy:... Lycee
Lakanal in Paris, put down for Eton, never went there, Jesuit day-school Prague,
two semesters Strasbourg, parents in European banking, small aristo, live apart.

“Hence our Jim’s wide familiarity with parts foreign, and his rather parentless
look, which I find irresistible. By the way: though he is made up of all different
bits of Europe, make no mistake: the completed version is devoutly our own. At
present, he is a bit of a striver and a puzzler, for he has just noticed that there is a

World Beyond the Touchline and that world is me.

“But you must first hear how I met him.

“As you know, it is my habit (and your command) now and then to put on
Arab costume and go down to the bazaars, there to sit among the great unwashed
and give ear to the word of their prophets, that I may in due course better
confound them. The juju man en vogue that evening came from the bosom of
Mother Russia herself: one Academician Khlebnikov, presently attached to the
Soviet Embassy in London, a jolly, rather infectious little fellow, who managed
some quite witty things among the usual nonsense. The bazaar in question was a
debating club called the Populars—our rival, dear Fan, and well known to you
from other forays I have occasionally made. After the sermon a wildly
proletarian coffee was served, to the accompaniment of a dreadfully democratic
bun, and I noticed this large fellow sitting alone at the back of the room,
apparently too shy to mingle. His face was familiar from the cricket field; it
turns out we both played in some silly scratch team without exchanging a word.

I don’t quite know how to describe him. He has it. Fan. I am serious now.”

Here the handwriting, till now ill-at-ease, spread out as the writer got into his
stride:

“He has that heavy quiet that commands. Hard-headed, quite literally. One of
those shrewd quiet ones that lead the team without anyone noticing. Fan, you
know how hard it is for me to act. You have to remind me all the time,
intellectually remind me, that unless I sample life’s dangers I shall never know
its mysteries. But Jim acts from instinct... he is functional. . . He’s my other
half; between us we’d make one marvellous man, except that neither of us can
sing. And, Fan, you know that feeling when you just have to go out and find
someone new or the world will die on you?”

The writing steadied again.

“ 'Yavas Lagloo,’ says I, which I understand is Russian for meet me in the
woodshed or something similar, and he says 'Oh, hullo,’ which I think he would
have said to the Archangel Gabriel if he’d happened to be passing.

“ 'What is your dilemma?’ says I.

“ 'I haven’t got one,’ says he, after about an hour’s thought.

“ 'Then what are you doing here? If you haven’t a dilemma, how did you get
in?’

“So he gives a big placid grin and we saunter over to the great Khlebnikov,
shake his tiny paw for a while, then toddle back to my rooms. Where we drink.
And drink. And, Fan, he drank everything in sight. Or perhaps I did, I forget.

And come the dawn, do you know what we did? I will tell you. Fan. We walked
solemnly down to the Parks, I sit on a bench with a stop-watch, and big Jim gets

into his running kit and lopes twenty circuits. Twenty. I was quite exhausted.

“We can come to you any time; he asks nothing better than to be in my
company or that of my wicked, divine friends. In short, he has appointed me his
Mephistopheles and I am vastly tickled by the compliment. By the by, he is
virgin, about eight feet tall, and built by the same firm that did Stonehenge. Do
not be alarmed.”

The file died again. Sitting up, Smiley turned the yellowed pages impatiently,
looking for stronger meat. The tutors of both men aver (twenty years later) that it
is inconceivable that the relationship between the two was “more than purely
friendly” ... Haydon’s evidence was never called ... Jim’s tutor speaks of him
as “intellectually omnivorous after long starvation”—dismisses any suggestion
that he was “pink.” The confrontation, which takes place at Sarratt, begins with
long apologies, particularly in view of Jim’s superb war record. Jim’s answers
breathe a pleasing straightforwardness after the extravagance of Haydon’s letter.
One representative of the competition present, but his voice is seldom heard. No,
Jim never again met Khlebnikov or anyone representing himself as his emissary
... No, he never spoke to him but on that one occasion. No, he had no other
contact with Communists or Russians at that time; he could not remember the
name of a single member of the Populars ...

Q: (Alleline) Shouldn’t think that keeps you awake, does it?

A: As a matter of fact, no. (Laughter)

Yes, he had been a member of the Populars just as he had been a member of
his college drama club, the philatelic society, the modern language society, the
Union and the historical society, the ethical society and the Rudolf Steiner study
group ... It was a way of getting to hear interesting lectures, and of meeting
people, particularly the second. No, he had never distributed left-wing literature,
though he did for a while take Soviet Weekly ... No, he had never paid dues to
any political party, at Oxford or later; as a matter of fact, he had never even used
his vote ... One reason why he joined so many clubs at Oxford was that after a
messy education abroad he had no natural English contemporaries from school.

By now the inquisitors are one and all on Jim’s side; everyone is on the same
side against the competition and its bureaucratic meddling.

Q: (Alleline) As a matter of interest, since you were overseas so much, do
you mind telling us where you learned your off-drive? (Laughter)

A: Oh, I had an uncle, actually, with a place outside Paris. He was cricket
mad. Had a net and all the equipment. When I went there for holidays, he

bowled at me non-stop.

[Inquisitors’ note: Comte Henri de Sainte-Yvonne, dec. 1942, P.F. AF64-
7.] End of interview. Competition representative would like to call
Haydon as a witness but Haydon is abroad and not available. Fixture
postponed sine die ...

Smiley was nearly asleep as he read the last entry on the file, tossed in
haphazard long after Jim’s formal clearance had come through from the
competition. It was a cutting from an Oxford newspaper of the day giving a
review of Haydon’s one-man exhibition in June, 1938, headed “Real or Surreal?
An Oxford Eye.”

Having torn the exhibition to shreds, the critic ended on this gleeful note: “We
understand that the distinguished Mr. James Prideaux took time off from his
cricket in order to help hang the canvases. He would have done better, in our
opinion, to remain in the Banbury Road. However, since his role of Dobbin to
the arts was the only heartfelt thing about the whole occasion, perhaps we had
better not sneer too loud ...”

He dozed, his mind a controlled clutter of doubts, suspicions, and certainties.
He thought of Ann, and in his tiredness cherished her profoundly, longing to
protect her frailty with his own. Like a young man, he whispered her name aloud
and imagined her beautiful face bowing over him in the half-light, while Mrs.
Pope Graham yelled prohibition through the keyhole. He thought of Tarr and
Irina, and pondered uselessly on love and loyalty; he thought of Jim Prideaux
and what tomorrow held. He was aware of a modest sense of approaching
conquest. He had been driven a long way; he had sailed backwards and
forwards. Tomorrow, if he was lucky, he might spot land: a peaceful little desert
island, for instance. Somewhere Karla had never heard of. Just for himself and
Ann. He fell asleep.

PART III

30

In Jim Prideaux’s world, Thursday had gone along like any other, except that
some time in the small hours of the morning the wounds in his shoulder-bone
started leaking, he supposed because of the inter-house run on Wednesday
afternoon. He was woken by the pain, and by the draught on the wet of his back
where the discharge flowed. The other time this happened he had driven himself
to Taunton General, but the nurses took one look at him and slapped him into
emergency to wait for doctor somebody and an X-ray, so he filched his clothes
and left. He’d done with hospitals and he’d done with medicos. English
hospitals, other hospitals—Jim had done with them. They called the discharge a
“track.”

He couldn’t reach the wound to treat it, but after last time he had hacked
himself triangles of lint and stitched strings to the corners. Having put these
handy on the draining board and prepared the hibitane, he heated hot water,
added half a packet of salt, and gave himself an improvised shower, crouching to
get his back under the jet. He soaked the lint in the hibitane, flung it across his
back, strapped it from the front, and lay face down on the bunk with a vodka
handy. The pain eased and a drowsiness came over him, but he knew if he gave
way to it he would sleep all day, so he took the vodka bottle to the window and
sat at the table correcting Five B French while Thursday’s dawn slipped into the
Dip and the rooks started their clatter in the elms.

Sometimes he thought of the wound as a memory he couldn’t keep down. He
tried his damnedest to patch it over and forget, but even his damnedest wasn’t
always enough.

He took the correcting slowly because he liked it, and because correcting kept
his mind in the right places. At six-thirty, seven, he was done so he put on some
old flannel bags and a sports coat and walked quietly down to the church, which
was never locked. There he knelt a moment in the centre aisle of the Curtois
antechapel, which was a family monument to the dead from two wars, and
seldom visited by anyone. The cross on the little altar had been carved by
sappers at Verdun. Still kneeling, Jim groped cautiously under the pew until his
fingertips discovered the line of several pieces of adhesive tape, and following
these, a casing of cold metal. His devotions over, he bashed up Combe Fane to
the hilltop, jogging a bit to get a sweat running, because the warm did him
wonders while it lasted, and rhythm soothed his vigilance.

After his sleepless night and the early-morning vodka, he was feeling a bit

light-headed, so when he saw the ponies down the combe, gawping at him with
their fool faces, he yelled at them in bad Somerset—“Git ’an there! Damned old
fools, take your silly eyes off me! ”—before pounding down the lane again for
coffee, and a change of bandage.

First lesson after prayers was Five B French, and there Jim all but lost his
temper: doled out a silly punishment to damn-fool Clements, draper’s son; had to
take it back at the end of class. In the common-room he went through another
routine, of the sort he had followed in the church: quickly, mindlessly, no fumble
and out. It was a simple enough notion, the mail check, but it worked. He’d
never heard of anyone else who used it, among the pros, but then pros don’t talk
about their game. “See it this way,” he would have said. “If the opposition is
watching you, it’s certain to be watching your mail, because mail’s the easiest
watch in the game—easier still if the opposition is the home side and has the co¬
operation of the postal service. So what do you do? Every week, from the same
post-box, at the same time, at the same rate, you post one envelope to yourself
and a second to an innocent party at the same address. Shove in a bit of trash—
charity Christmas-card literature, come-on from local supermarket—be sure to
seal envelope, stand back and compare times of arrival. If your letter turns up
later than the other feller’s, you’ve just felt someone’s hot breath on you—in this
case, Toby’s.”

Jim called it, in his odd, chipped vocabulary, water-testing, and once again the
temperature was unobjectionable. The two letters clocked in together, but Jim
arrived too late to pinch back the one addressed to Marjoribanks, whose turn it
was to act as unwitting running mate. So, having pocketed his own, Jim snorted
at the Daily Telegraph while Marjoribanks, with an irritable “Oh, to hell,” tore
up a printed invitation to join the Bible Reading Fellowship. From there, school
routine carried him again till junior rugger versus St. Ermin’s, which he was
billed to referee. It was a fast game and when it was over his back acted up
again, so he drank vodka till first bell, which he’d promised to take for young
Elwes. He couldn’t remember why he’d promised, but the younger staff and
specially the married ones relied on him a lot for odd jobs and he let it happen.
The bell was an old ship’s tocsin, something Thursgood’s father had dug up and
now part of the tradition. As Jim rang it, he was aware of little Bill Roach
standing right beside him, peering up at him with a white smile, wanting his
attention, as he wanted it half a dozen times each day.

“Hullo, there, Jumbo, what’s your headache this time?”

“Sir, please, sir.”

“Come on, Jumbo, out with it.”

“Sir, there’s someone asking where you live, sir,” said Roach.

Jim put down the bell.

“What sort of someone, Jumbo? Come on, I won’t bite you, come on, hey ...
hey! What sort of someone? Man someone? Woman? Juju man? Hey! Come on,
old feller,” he said softly, crouching to Roach’s height. “No need to cry. What’s
the matter, then? Got a temperature?” He pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve.
“What sort of someone?” he repeated in the same low voice.

“He asked at Mrs. McCullum’s. He said he was a friend. Then he got back
into his car; it’s parked in the churchyard, sir.” A fresh gust of tears. “He’s just
sitting in it.”

“Get the hell away, damn you!” Jim called to a bunch of seniors grinning in a
doorway. “Get the hell!” He went back to Roach. “Tall friend?” he asked softly.
“Sloppy tall kind of fellow, Jumbo? Eyebrows and a stoop? Thin feller?
Bradbury, come here and stop gawping! Stand by to take Jumbo up to Matron!
Thin feller?” he asked again, very steady.

But Roach had run out of words. He had no memory any more, no sense of
size or perspective; his faculty of selection in the adult world had gone. Big men,
small men, old, young, crooked, straight—they were a single army of
indistinguishable dangers. To say no to Jim was more than he could bear; to say
yes was to shoulder the whole awful responsibility of disappointing him. He saw
Jim’s eyes on him; he saw the smile go out and he felt the merciful touch of a big
hand upon his arm.

“Attaboy, Jumbo. Nobody ever watched like you, did they?”

Laying his head hopelessly against Bradbury’s shoulder. Bill Roach closed his
eyes. When he opened them, he saw through his tears that Jim was already
halfway up the staircase.

Jim felt calm; almost easy. For days he had known there was someone. That also
was part of his routine: to watch the places where the watchers asked. The
church, where the ebb and flow of the local population is a ready topic; county
hall, register of electors; tradesmen, if they kept customer accounts; pubs, if the
quarry didn’t use them. In England, he knew these were the natural traps that
watchers automatically patrolled before they closed on you. And, sure enough, in
Taunton two days ago, chatting pleasantly with the assistant librarian, Jim had
come across the footprint he was looking for. A stranger, apparently down from
London, had been interested in village wards; yes, a political gentleman—well,
more in the line of political research, he was—professional, you could tell—and
one of the things he had wanted—fancy that, now—was the up-to-date record of
Jim’s very village—yes, the voters’ list—as they were thinking of making a
door-to-door survey of a really out-of-the-way community, specially new

immigrants . . . Yes, fancy that, Jim agreed, and, from then on, made his
dispositions. He bought railway tickets to places—Taunton to Exeter, Taunton to
London, Taunton to Swindon, valid one month—because he knew that if he were
on the run again, tickets would be hard to come by. He had uncached his old
identities and his gun, and hid them handily above ground; he dumped a suitcase
full of clothes in the boot of the Alvis, and kept the tank full. These precautions
eased his fears a little, made sleep a possibility; or would have done, before his
back.

“Sir, who won, sir?”

Prebble, a new boy, in dressing gown and toothpaste, on his way to surgery.
Sometimes boys spoke to Jim for no reason; his size and crookedness were a
challenge.

“Sir, the match, sir, versus Saint Ermin’s.”

“Saint Vermin’s, ” another boy piped. “Yes, sir, who won, actually?”

“Sir, they did, sir,” Jim barked. “As you’d have known, sir, if you’d been
watching, sir, ” and swinging an enormous fist at them in a slow feinted punch,
he propelled both boys across the corridor to Matron’s dispensary.

“Night, sir.”

“Night, you toads,” Jim sang, and stepped the other way into the sick-bay for
a view of the church and the cemetery. The sick-bay was unlit; it had a look and
a stink he hated. Twelve boys lay in the gloom, dozing between supper and
temperatures.

“Who’s that?” asked a hoarse voice.

“Rhino,” said another. “Hey, Rhino, who won against Saint Vermin’s?”

To call Jim by his nickname was insubordinate, but boys in sick-bay feel free
from discipline.

“Rhino? Who the hell’s Rhino? Don’t know him. Not a name to me,” Jim
snorted, squeezing between two beds. “Put that torch away—not allowed. Damn
walk-over, that’s who won. Eighteen to nothing for Vermin’s.” That window
went down almost to the floor. An old fireguard protected it from boys. “Too
much damn fumble in the three-quarter line,” he muttered, peering down.

“I hate rugger,” said a boy called Stephen.

The blue Ford was parked in the shadow of the church, close in under the
elms. From the ground floor it would have been out of sight but it didn’t look
hidden. Jim stood very still, a little back from the window, studying it for telltale
signs. The light was fading fast, but his eyesight was good and he knew what to
look for: discreet aerial, second inside mirror for the legman, burn marks under

the exhaust. Sensing the tension in him, the boys became facetious.

“Sir, is it a bird, sir? Is she any good, sir?”

“Sir, are we on fire?”

“Sir, what are her legs like?”

“Gosh, sir, don’t say it’s Miss Aaronson?” At this everyone started giggling,
because Miss Aaronson was old and ugly.

“Shut up,” Jim snapped, quite angry. “Rude pigs, shut up.” Downstairs in
assembly, Thursgood was calling senior roll before prep.

Abercrombie? Sir. Astor? Sir. Blakeney? Sick, sir.

Still watching, Jim saw the car door open and George Smiley climb cautiously
out, wearing a heavy overcoat.

Matron’s footsteps sounded in the corridor. He heard the squeak of her rubber
heels and the rattle of thermometers in a paste pot.

“My good Rhino, whatever are you doing in my sick-bay? And close that
curtain, you bad boy—you’ll have the whole lot of them dying of pneumonia.
William Merridew, sit up at once.”

Smiley was locking the car door. He was alone and he carried nothing, not
even a briefcase.

“They’re screaming for you in Grenville, Rhino.”

“Going, gone,” Jim retorted briskly and with a jerky “Night, all,” he humped
his way to Grenville dormitory, where he was pledged to finish a story by John
Buchan. Reading aloud, he noticed that there were certain sounds he had trouble
pronouncing; they caught somewhere in his throat. He knew he was sweating, he
guessed his back was seeping, and by the time he had finished there was a
stiffness round his jaw that was not just from reading aloud. But all these things
were small symptoms beside the rage that was mounting in him as he plunged
into the freezing night air. For a moment, on the overgrown terrace, he hesitated,
staring at the church. It would take him three minutes, less, to untape the gun
from underneath the pew, shove it into the waistband of his trousers, left side,
butt inward to the groin . . .

But instinct advised him “no,” so he set course directly for the trailer, singing
“Hey, diddle-diddle” as loud as his tuneless voice would carry.

31

Inside the motel room, the state of restlessness was constant. Even when the
traffic outside went through one of its rare lulls, the windows continued
vibrating. In the bathroom the tooth glasses also vibrated, while from either wall
and above them they could hear music, thumps, and bits of conversation or
laughter. When a car arrived in the forecourt, the slam of the door seemed to
happen inside the room, and the footsteps too. Of the furnishings, everything
matched. The yellow chairs matched the yellow pictures and the yellow carpet.
The candlewick bedspreads matched the orange paintwork on the doors, and by
coincidence the label on the vodka bottle. Smiley had arranged things properly.
He had spaced the chairs and put the vodka on the low table, and now as Jim sat
glaring at him he extracted a plate of smoked salmon from the tiny refrigerator,
and brown bread already buttered. His mood in contrast to Jim’s was noticeably
bright, his movements swift and purposeful.

“I thought we should at least be comfortable,” he said, with a short smile,
setting things busily on the table. “When do you have to be at school again? Is
there a particular time?” Receiving no answer, he sat down. “How do you like
teaching? I seem to remember you had a spell of it after the war—is that right?
Before they hauled you back? Was that also a prep school? I don’t think I knew.”

“Look at the file,” Jim barked. “Don’t you come here playing cat-and-mouse
with me, George Smiley. If you want to know things, read my file.”

Reaching across the table, Smiley poured two drinks and handed one to Jim.

“Your personal file at the Circus?”

“Get it from housekeepers. Get it from Control.”

“I suppose I should,” said Smiley doubtfully. “The trouble is Control’s dead
and I was thrown out long before you came back. Didn’t anyone bother to tell
you that when they got you home?”

A softening came over Jim’s face at this, and he made in slow motion one of
those gestures which so amused the boys at Thursgood’s. “Dear God,” he
muttered, “so Control’s gone,” and passed his left hand over the fangs of his
moustache, then upward to his moth-eaten hair. “Poor old devil,” he muttered.
“What did he die of, George? Heart? Heart kill him?”

“They didn’t even tell you this at the debriefing?” Smiley asked.

At the mention of a debriefing, Jim stiffened and his glare returned.

“Yes,” said Smiley. “It was his heart.”

“Who got the job?”

Smiley laughed. “My goodness, Jim, what did you all talk about at Sarratt, if
they didn’t even tell you that?”

“God damn it, who got the job? Wasn’t you, was it—threw you out! Who got
the job, George?”

“Alleline got it,” said Smiley, watching Jim very carefully, noting how the
right forearm rested motionless across the knees. “Who did you want to get it?
Have a candidate, did you, Jim?” And after a long pause: “And they didn’t tell
you what happened to the Aggravate network, by any chance? To Pribyl, to his
wife, and brother-in-law? Or the Plato network? Landkron, Eva Krieglova,
Hanka Bilova? You recruited some of those, didn’t you, in the old days before
Roy Bland? Old Landkron even worked for you in the war.”

There was something terrible just then about the way Jim would not move
forward and could not move back. His red face was twisted with the strain of
indecision and the sweat had gathered in studs over his shaggy ginger eyebrows.

“God damn you, George, what the devil do you want? I’ve drawn a line.
That’s what they told me to do. Draw a line, make a new life, forget the whole
thing.”

“Which they is this, Jim? Roy? Bill, Percy?” He waited. “Did they tell you
what happened to Max, whoever they were? Max is all right, by the way.”
Rising, he briskly refreshed Jim’s drink, then sat again.

“All right, come on, so what’s happened to the networks?”

“They’re blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin. I don’t
believe it. But I have to know what happened.” He went on, “I know Gontrol
made you promise by all that’s holy, but that’s finished. I know you’ve been
questioned to death and I know you’ve pushed some things so far down you can
hardly find them any more or tell the difference between truth and cover. I know
you’ve tried to draw a line under it and say it didn’t happen. I’ve tried that, too.
Well, after tonight you can draw your line. I’ve brought a letter from Lacon and
if you want to ring him he’s standing by. I don’t want to silence you. I’d rather
you talked. Why didn’t you come and see me at home when you got back? You
could have done. You tried to see me before you left, so why not when you got
back? Wasn’t just the rules that kept you away.”

“Didn’t anyone get out?” Jim said.

“No. They seem to have been shot.”

They had telephoned Lacon and now Smiley sat alone sipping his drink. Prom
the bathroom he could hear the sound of running taps and grunts as Jim sluiced
water in his face.

“Lor God’s sake, let’s get somewhere we can breathe,” Jim whispered when

he came back, as if it were a condition of his talking. Smiley picked up the bottle
and walked beside him as they crossed the tarmac to the car.

They drove for twenty minutes, Jim at the wheel. When they parked, they
were on the plateau, this morning’s hilltop free of fog, and a long view down the
valley. Scattered lights reached into the distance. Jim sat as still as iron, right
shoulder high and hands hung down, gazing through the misted windscreen at
the shadow of the hills. The sky was light and Jim’s face was cut sharp against it.
Smiley kept his first questions short. The anger had left Jim’s voice and little by
little he spoke with greater ease. Once, discussing Control’s tradecraft, he even
laughed, but Smiley never relaxed; he was as cautious as if he were leading a
child across the street. When Jim ran on, or bridled, or showed a flash of temper,
Smiley gently drew him back until they were level again, moving at the same
pace and in the same direction. When Jim hesitated, Smiley coaxed him forward
over the obstacle. At first, by a mixture of instinct and deduction, Smiley
actually fed Jim his own story.

For Jim’s first briefing by Control, Smiley suggested, they had made a
rendezvous outside the Circus? They had. Where? At a service flat in St.

James’s, a place proposed by Control. Was anyone else present? No one. And to
get in touch with Jim in the first place. Control had used MacFadean, his
personal janitor? Yes, old Mac came over on the Brixton shuttle with a note
asking Jim for a meeting that night. Jim was to tell Mac yes or no and give him
back the note. He was on no account to use the telephone, even the internal line,
to discuss the arrangement. Jim had told Mac yes and arrived at seven.

“First, I suppose. Control cautioned you?”

“Told me not to trust anyone.”

“Did he name particular people?”

“Later,” said Jim. “Not at first. At first, he just said trust nobody. Specially
nobody in the mainstream. George?”

“Yes.”

“They were shot all right, were they? Landkron, Krieglova, Bilova, the
Pribyls? Straight shooting?”

“The secret police rolled up both networks the same night. After that no one
knows, but next of kin were told they were dead. That usually means they are.”

To their left, a line of pine trees like a motionless army climbed out of the
valley.

“And then, I suppose. Control asked you what Czech identities you had
running for you,” Smiley resumed. “Is that right?”

He had to repeat the question.

“I told him Hajek,” said Jim finally. “Vladimir Hajek, Czech journalist based

on Paris. Control asked me how much longer the papers were good for. 'You
never know/ I said. 'Sometimes they’re blown after one trip.’ ” His voice went
suddenly louder, as if he had lost his hold on it. “Deaf as an adder, Control was,
when he wanted to be.”

“So then he told you what he wanted you to do,” Smiley suggested.

“First, we discussed deniability. He said if I was caught, I should keep Control
out of it. A scalp-hunter ploy, bit of private enterprise. Even at the time I thought.
Who the hell will ever believe that? Every word he spoke was letting blood,”
said Jim. “All through the briefing, I could feel his resistance to telling me
anything. He didn’t want me to know but he wanted me well briefed. 'I’ve had
an offer of service,’ Control says. 'Highly placed official, cover name Testify.’
'Czech official?’ I ask. 'On the military side,’ he says. 'You’re a military minded
man, Jim, you two should hit it off pretty well.’ That’s how it went, the whole
damn way. I thought. If you don’t want to tell me, don’t, but stop dithering.”

After more circling, said Jim, Control announced that Testify was a Czech
general of artillery. His name was Stevcek; he was known as a pro-Soviet hawk
in the Prague defence hierarchy, whatever that was worth; he had worked in
Moscow on liaison and was one of the very few Czechs the Russians trusted.
Stevcek had conveyed to Control, through an intermediary whom Control had
personally interviewed in Austria, his desire to talk to a ranking officer of the
Circus on matters of mutual interest. The emissary must be a Czech speaker,
somebody able to take decisions. On Friday, October 20th, Stevcek would be
inspecting the weapon research station at Tisnov, near Brno, about a hundred
miles north of the Austrian border. From there he would be visiting a hunting-
lodge for the weekend, alone. It was a place high up in the forests not far from
Racice. He would be willing to receive an emissary there on the evening of
Saturday, the twenty-first. He would also supply an escort to and from Brno.

Smiley asked, “Did Control have any suggestions about Stevcek’s motive?”

“A girlfriend,” Jim said. “Student he was going with, having a last spring.
Control said; twenty years’ age difference between them. She was shot during
the uprising of summer ’68. Till then, Stevcek had managed to bury his anti-
Russian feelings in favour of his career. The girl’s death put an end to all that: he
was out for their blood. For four years he’d lain low acting friendly and salting
away information that would really hurt them. Soon as we gave him assurances
and fixed the trade routes, he was ready to sell.”

“Had Control checked any of this?”

“What he could. Stevcek was well enough documented. Hungry desk general
with a long list of staff appointments. Technocrat. When he wasn’t on courses,
he was sharpening his teeth abroad: Warsaw, Moscow, Peking for a year, spell of

military attache in Africa, Moscow again. Young for his rank.”

“Did Control tell you what you were to expect in the way of information?”

“Defence material. Rocketry. Ballistics.”

“Anything else?” said Smiley, passing the bottle.

“Bit of politics.”

“Anything else?”

Not for the first time, Smiley had the distinct sense of stumbling not on Jim’s
ignorance but on the relic of a willed determination not to remember. In the dark,
Jim Prideaux’s breathing became suddenly deep and greedy. He had lifted his
hands to the top of the wheel and was resting his chin on them, peering blankly
at the frosted windscreen.

“How long were they in the bag before being shot?” Jim demanded to know.

“I’m afraid, a lot longer than you were,” Smiley confessed.

“Holy God,” said Jim. With a handkerchief taken from his sleeve, he wiped
away the perspiration and whatever else was glistening on his face.

“The intelligence Control was hoping to get out of Stevcek,” Smiley
prompted, ever so softly.

“That’s what they asked me at the interrogation.”

“At Sarratt?”

Jim shook his head. “Over there.” He nodded his untidy head towards the
hills. “They knew it was Control’s operation from the start. There was nothing I
could say to persuade them it was mine. They laughed.”

Once again Smiley waited patiently till Jim was ready to go on.

“Stevcek,” said Jim. “Control had this bee in his bonnet: Stevcek would
provide the answer, Stevcek would provide the key. 'What key?’ I asked. 'What
key?’ Had his bag, that old brown music case. Pulled out charts, annoted all in
his own handwriting. Charts in coloured inks, crayons. 'Your visual aid,’ he says.
'This is the fellow you’ll be meeting.’ Stevcek’s career plotted year by year: took
me right through it. Military academies, medals, wives. 'He’s fond of horses,’ he
says. 'You used to ride yourself, Jim. Something else in common—remember it.’
I thought. That’ll be fun, sitting in Czecho with the dogs after me, talking about
breaking thoroughbred mares.” He laughed a little strangely, so Smiley laughed,
too.

“The appointments in red were for Stevcek’s Soviet liaison work. Green were
his intelligence work. Stevcek had had a finger in everything. Fourth man in
Czech army intelligence, chief boffin on weaponry, secretary to the national
internal security committee, military counsellor of some sort to the Praesidium,
Anglo-American desk in the Czech military intelligence set-up. Then Control
comes to this patch in the mid-sixties, Stevcek’s second spell in Moscow, and it’s

marked green and red fifty-fifty. Ostensibly, Stevcek was attached to the Warsaw
Pact Liaison staff as a colonel general, says Control, but that was just cover.
'He’d nothing to do with the Warsaw Pact Liaison staff. His real job was in
Moscow Centre’s England section. He operated under the workname of Minin,’
he says. 'His job was dovetailing Czech efforts with Centre’s. This is the
treasure,’ Control says. 'What Stevcek really wants to sell us is the name of
Moscow Centre’s mole inside the Circus.’ ”

It might be only one word, Smiley thought, remembering Max, and felt again
that sudden wave of apprehension. In the end, he knew, that was all it would be:
a name for the mole Gerald, a scream in the dark.

“ 'There’s a rotten apple, Jim,’ Control said, 'and he’s infecting all the others.’
” Jim was going straight on. His voice had stiffened, his manner also. “Kept
talking about elimination, how he’d backtracked and researched and was nearly
there. There were five possibilities, he said. Don’t ask me how he dug them up.
'It’s one of the top five,’ he says. 'Five fingers to a hand.’ He gave me a drink
and we sat there like a pair of schoolboys making up a code, me and Control. We
used Tinker, Tailor. We sat there in the flat putting it together, drinking that
cheap Cyprus sherry he always gave. If 1 couldn’t get out, if there was any
fumble after I’d met Stevcek, if 1 had to go underground, 1 must get the one word
to him, even if 1 had to go to Prague and chalk it on the Embassy door or ring the
Prague resident and yell it at him down the phone. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor.
Alleline was Tinker, Haydon was Tailor, Bland was Soldier, and Toby Esterhase
was Poorman. We dropped Sailor because it rhymed with Tailor. You were
Beggarman,” Jim said.

“Was 1, now? And how did you take to it, Jim, to Control’s theory? How did
the idea strike you, over-all?”

“Damn silly. Poppycock.”

“Why?”

“Just damn silly,” he repeated in a tone of military stubbornness. “Think of
any one of you—mole— mad! ”

“But did you believe it?”

“No! Lord alive, man, why do you—”

“Why not? Rationally we always accepted that sooner or later it would
happen. We always warned one another: be on your guard. We’ve turned up
enough members of other outfits: Russians, Poles, Czechs, French. Even the odd
American. What’s so special about the British, all of a sudden?”

Sensing Jim’s antagonism, Smiley opened his door and let the cold air pour in.

“How about a stroll?” he said. “No point in being cooped up when we can
walk around.”

With movement, as Smiley had anticipated, Jim found a new fluency of
speech.

They were on the western rim of the plateau, with only a few trees standing
and several lying felled. A frosted bench was offered, but they ignored it. There
was no wind, the stars were very clear, and as Jim took up his story they went on
walking side by side, Jim adjusting always to Smiley’s pace, now away from the
car, now back again. Occasionally they drew up, shoulder to shoulder, facing
down the valley.

First Jim described his recruitment of Max and the manoeuvres he went
through in order to disguise his mission from the rest of the Circus. He let it leak
that he had a tentative lead to a high-stepping Soviet cypher clerk in Stockholm,
and booked himself to Copenhagen in his old workname Ellis. Instead, he flew
to Paris, switched to his Hajek papers, and landed by scheduled flight at Prague
airport at ten on Saturday morning. He went through the barriers like a song,
confirmed the time of his train at the terminus, then took a walk because he had
a couple of hours to kill and thought he might watch his back a little before he
left for Brno. That autumn there had been freak bad weather. There was snow on
the ground and more falling.

In Czecho, said Jim, surveillance was not usually a problem. The security
services knew next to nothing about street-watching, probably because no
administration in living memory had ever had to feel shy about it. The tendency,
said Jim, was still to throw cars and pavement artists around like A1 Capone, and
that was what Jim was looking for: black Skodas and trios of squat men in
trilbies. In the cold, spotting these things is marginally harder because the traffic
is slow, the people walk faster, and everyone is muffled to the nose. All the
same, till he reached Masaryk Station—or Central, as they’re pleased to call it
these days—he had no worries. But at Masaryk, said Jim, he got a whisper, more
instinct than fact, about two women who’d bought tickets ahead of him.

Here, with the dispassionate ease of a professional, Jim went back over the
ground. In a covered shopping arcade beside Wenceslaus Square he had been
overtaken by three women, of whom the one in the middle was pushing a pram.
The woman nearest the curb carried a red plastic handbag and the woman on the
inside was walking a dog on a lead. Ten minutes later two other women came
towards him, arm in arm, both in a hurry, and it crossed his mind that if Toby
Esterhase had had the running of the job, an arrangement like this would be his
handwriting; quick profile changes from the pram, backup cars standing off with
short-wave radio or bleep, with a second team lying back in case the forward
party overran. At Masaryk, looking at the two women ahead of him in the ticket
queue, Jim was faced with the knowledge that it was happening now. There is

one garment that a watcher has neither time nor inclination to change, least of all
in sub-Arctic weather, and that is his shoes. Of the two pairs offered for his
inspection in the ticket queue, Jim recognised one: furlined plastic, black, with
zips on the outside and soles of a thick brown composition that sang slightly in
the snow. He had seen them once already that morning, in the Sterba passage,
worn with different top clothes by the woman who had pushed past him with the
pram. From then on, Jim didn’t suspect. He knew, just as Smiley would have
known.

At the station bookstall, Jim bought himself a Rude Pravo and boarded the
Brno train. If they had wanted to arrest him, they would have done so by now.
They must be after the branch lines: they were following Jim in order to house
his contacts. There was no point in looking for reasons, but Jim guessed that the
Hajek identity was blown and they’d primed the trap the moment he booked
himself on the plane. As long as they didn’t know he had flushed them, he still
had the edge, said Jim; and for a moment Smiley was back in occupied
Germany, in his own time as a field agent, living with terror in his mouth, naked
to every stranger’s glance.

He was supposed to catch the thirteen-eight arriving Brno sixteen-twenty-
seven. It was cancelled, so he took some wonderful stopping train, a special for
the football match, which called at every other lamp-post, and each time Jim
reckoned he could pick out the hoods. The quality was variable. At Chocen, a
one-horse place if ever he saw one, he got out and bought himself a sausage, and
there were no fewer than five, all men, spread down the tiny platform with their
hands in their pockets, pretending to chat to one another and making damn fools
of themselves.

“If there’s one thing that distinguishes a good watcher from a bad one,” said
Jim, “it’s the gentle art of doing damn all convincingly.”

At Svitavy two men and a woman entered his carriage and talked about the
big match. After a while Jim joined the conversation; he had been reading up the
form in his newspaper. It was a club replay, and everyone was going crazy about
it. By Brno, nothing more had happened, so he got out and sauntered through
shops and crowded areas where they had to stay close for fear of losing him.

He wanted to lull them, demonstrate to them that he suspected nothing. He
knew now that he was the target of what Toby would call a grand-slam
operation. On foot they were working teams of seven. The cars changed so often
he couldn’t count them. The over-all direction came from a scruffy green van
driven by a thug. The van had a loop aerial and a chalk star scrawled high on the
back where no child could reach. The cars, where he picked them out, were
declared to one another by a woman’s handbag on the gloveboard and a

passenger sun visor turned down. He guessed there were other signs but those
two were good enough for him. He knew from what Toby had told him that jobs
like this could cost a hundred people and were unwieldy if the quarry bolted.
Toby hated them for that reason.

There is one store in Brno main square that sells everything, said Jim.
Shopping in Czecho is usually a bore because there are so few retail outlets for
each state industry, but this place was new and quite impressive. He bought
children’s toys, a scarf, some cigarettes, and tried on shoes. He guessed his
watchers were still waiting for his clandestine contact. He stole a fur hat and a
white plastic raincoat and a carrier bag to put them in. He loitered at the men’s
department long enough to confirm that two women who formed the forward
pair were still behind him but reluctant to come too close. He guessed they had
signalled for men to take over, and were waiting. In the men’s lavatory he moved
very fast. He pulled the white raincoat over his overcoat, stuffed the carrier bag
into the pocket, and put on the fur hat. He abandoned his remaining parcels, then
ran like a madman down the emergency staircase, smashed open a fire door,
pelted down an alley, strolled up another, which was one-way, stuffed the white
raincoat into the carrier bag, sauntered into another store, which was just closing,
and there bought a black raincoat to replace the white one. Using the departing
shoppers for cover, he squeezed into a crowded tram, stayed aboard till the last
stop but one, walked for an hour, and made the fallback with Max to the minute.

Here he described his dialogue with Max and said they nearly had a standing
fight.

Smiley asked, “It never crossed your mind to drop the job?”

“No. It did not,” Jim snapped, his voice rising in a threat.

“Although, right from the start, you thought the idea was poppycock?” There
was nothing but deference in Smiley’s tone. No edge, no wish to score: only a
wish to have the truth, clear under the night sky. “You just kept marching. You’d
seen what was on your back, you thought the mission absurd, but you still went
on, deeper and deeper into the jungle.”

“I did.”

“Had you perhaps changed your mind about the mission? Did curiosity draw
you, after all—was that it? You wanted passionately to know who the mole was,
for instance? I’m only speculating, Jim.”

“What’s the difference? What the hell does my motive matter in a damn mess
like this?”

The half-moon was free of cloud and seemed very close. Jim sat on the bench.
It was bedded in loose gravel, and while he spoke he occasionally picked up a
pebble and flicked it backhand into the bracken. Smiley sat beside him, looking

nowhere but at Jim. Once, to keep him company, he took a pull of vodka and
thought of Tarr and Irina drinking on their hilltop in Hong Kong. It must be a
habit of the trade, he decided: we talk better when there’s a view.

Through the window of the parked Fiat, said Jim, the word code passed off
without a hitch. The driver was one of those stiff, muscle-bound Czech Magyars
with an Edwardian moustache and a mouthful of garlic. Jim didn’t like him but
he hadn’t expected to. The two back doors were locked and there was a row
about where he should sit. The Magyar said it was insecure for Jim to be in the
back. It was also undemocratic. Jim told him to go to hell. He asked Jim whether
he had a gun, and Jim said no, which was not true, but if the Magyar didn’t
believe him he didn’t dare say so. He asked whether Jim had brought
instructions for the General. Jim said he had brought nothing. He had come to
listen.

Jim felt a bit nervy, he said. They drove and the Magyar said his piece. When
they reached the lodge, there would be no lights and no sign of life. The General
would be inside. If there was any sign of life—a bicycle, a car, a light, a dog—if
there was any sign that the hut was occupied, then the Magyar would go in first
and Jim would wait in the car. Otherwise Jim should go in alone and the Slav
would do the waiting. Was that clear?

Why didn’t they just go in together? Jim asked. Because the General didn’t
want them to, said the Slav.

They drove for half an hour by Jim’s watch, heading north east at an average
of thirty kilometres an hour. The track was winding and steep and tree-lined.
There was no moon and he could see very little except occasionally against the
skyline more forest, more hilltops. The snow had come from the north, he
noticed; it was a point that was useful later. The track was clear but rutted by
heavy lorries. They drove without lights. The Magyar had begun telling a dirty
story and Jim guessed it was his way of being nervous. The smell of garlic was
awful. He seemed to chew it all the time. Without warning, he cut the engine.
They were running downhill, but more slowly. They had not quite stopped when
the Magyar reached for the handbrake and Jim smashed his head against the
window-post and took his gun. They were at the opening to a side-path. Thirty
yards down this path lay a low wooden hut. There was no sign of life.

Jim told the Magyar what he would like him to do. He would like him to wear
Jim’s fur hat and Jim’s coat and take the walk for him. He should take it slowly,
keeping his hands linked behind his back, and walking at the centre of the path.
If he failed to do either of those things, Jim would shoot him. When he reached
the hut, he should go inside and explain to the General that Jim was indulging in
an elementary precaution. Then he should walk back slowly, report to Jim that

all was well, and that the General was ready to receive him. Or not, as the case
might be.

The Magyar didn’t seem very happy about this but he didn’t have much
choice. Before he got out, Jim made him turn the car round and face it down the
path. If there was any monkey business, Jim explained, he would put on the
headlights and shoot him along the beam, not once but several times, and not in
the legs. The Magyar began his walk. He had nearly reached the hut when the
whole area was floodlit: the hut, the path, and a large space around. Then a
number of things happened at once. Jim didn’t see everything, because he was
busy turning the car. He saw four men fall out of the trees, and so far as he could
work out, one of them had sandbagged the Magyar. Shooting started but none of
the four paid it any attention; they were standing back while somebody took
photographs. The shooting seemed to be directed at the clear sky behind the
floodlights. It was very theatrical. Flares exploded. Very lights went up, even
tracers, and as Jim raced the Fiat down the track, he had the impression of
leaving a military tattoo at its climax. He was almost clear—he really felt he was
clear—when from the woods to his right someone opened up with a machine-
gun at close quarters. The first burst shot off a back wheel and turned the car
over. He saw the wheel fly over the bonnet as the car took to the ditch on the left.
The ditch might have been ten feet deep but the snow let him down kindly. The
car didn’t burn so he lay behind it and waited, facing across the track hoping to
get a shot at the machine-gunner. The next burst came from behind him and
threw him up against the car. The woods must have been crawling with troops.
He knew that he had been hit twice. Both shots caught him in the right shoulder
and it seemed amazing to him, as he lay there watching the tattoo, that they
hadn’t taken off the arm. A klaxon sounded, maybe two or three. An ambulance
rolled down the track and there was still enough shooting to frighten the game
for years. The ambulance reminded him of those old Hollywood fire engines, it
was so upright. A whole mock battle was taking place, yet the ambulance boys
stood gazing at him without a care in the world. He was losing consciousness as
he heard a second car arrive, and men’s voices, and more photographs were
taken, this time of the right man. Someone gave orders, but he couldn’t tell what
they were because they were given in Russian. His one thought, as they dumped
him on the stretcher and the lights went out, concerned going back to London.

He imagined himself in the St. James’s flat, with the coloured charts and the
sheaf of notes, sitting in the armchair and explaining to Control how in their old
age the two of them had walked into the biggest sucker’s punch in the history of
the trade. His only consolation was that they had sandbagged the Magyar, but
looking back Jim wished very much he’d broken his neck for him: it was a thing

he could have managed very easily, and without compunction.

32

The describing of pain was to Jim an indulgence to be dispensed with. To
Smiley, his stoicism had something awesome about it, the more so because he
seemed unaware of it. The gaps in his story came mainly where he passed out,
he explained. The ambulance drove him, so far as he could fathom, further north.
He guessed this from the trees when they opened the door to let the doctor in: the
snow was heaviest when he looked back. The surface was good and he guessed
they were on the road to Hradec. The doctor gave him an injection; he came
round in a prison hospital with barred windows high up, and three men watching
him. He came round again after the operation, in a different cell with no
windows at all, and he thought probably the first questioning took place there,
about seventy-two hours after they’d patched him up, but time was already a
problem and of course they’d taken away his watch.

They moved him a lot. Either to different rooms, depending on what they were
going to do with him, or to other prisons, depending on who was questioning
him. Sometimes they just moved to keep him awake, walking him down cell
corridors at night. He was also moved in lorries, and once by a Czech transport
plane, but he was trussed for the flight and hooded, and passed out soon after
they took off. The interrogation which followed this flight was very long.
Otherwise he had little sense of progression from one questioning to another and
thinking didn’t get it any straighter for him—rather the reverse. The thing that
was still strongest in his memory was the plan of campaign he formed while he
waited for the first interrogation to begin. He knew silence would be impossible
and that for his own sanity, or survival, there had to be a dialogue, and at the end
of it they had to think he had told them what he knew, all he knew. Lying in
hospital, he prepared his mind into lines of defence behind which, if he was
lucky, he could fall back stage by stage until he had given the impression of total
defeat. His forward line, he reckoned, and his most expendable, was the bare
bones of Operation Testify. It was anyone’s guess whether Stevcek was a plant,
or had been betrayed. But whichever was the case, one thing was certain: the
Czechs knew more about Stevcek than Jim did. His first concession, therefore,
would be the Stevcek story, since they had it already; but he would make them
work for it. First he would deny everything and stick to his cover. After a fight,
he would admit to being a British spy and give his workname Ellis, so that if
they published it, the Circus would at least know he was alive and trying. He had
little doubt that the elaborate trap and the photographs augured a lot of ballyhoo.

After that, in accordance with his understanding with Control, he would describe
the operation as his own show, mounted without the consent of his superiors, and
calculated to win him favour. And he would bury, as deep as they could go and
deeper, all thoughts of a spy inside the Circus.

“No mole,” said Jim, to the black outlines of the Quantocks. “No meeting with
Control, no service flat in St. James’s.”

“No Tinker, Tailor.”

His second line of defence would be Max. He proposed at first to deny that he
had brought a legman at all. Then he might say he had brought one but didn’t
know his name. Then, because everyone likes a name, he would give them one:
the wrong one first, then the right one. By that time Max must be clear, or
underground, or caught.

Now came in Jim’s imagination a succession of less strongly held positions:
recent scalp-hunter operations. Circus tittle-tattle—anything to make his
interrogators think he was broken and talking free and that this was all he had,
they had passed the last trench. He would rack his memory for back scalp-hunter
cases, and if necessary he would give them the names of one or two Soviet and
satellite officials who had recently been turned or burned; of others who in the
past had made a one-time sale of assets and, since they had not defected, might
now be considered to be in line for burning or a second bite. He would throw
them any bone he could think of—sell them, if necessary, the entire Brixton
stable. And all of this would be the smokescreen to disguise what seemed to Jim
to be his most vulnerable intelligence, since they would certainly expect him to
possess it: the identity of members of the Czech end of the Aggravate and Plato
networks.

“Landkron, Krieglova, Bilova, the Pribyls,” said Jim.

Why did he choose the same order for their names? Smiley wondered.

For a long time Jim had had no responsibility for these networks. Years
earlier, before he took over Brixton, he had helped establish them, recruited
some of the founder members; since then, a lot had happened to them in the
hands of Bland and Haydon of which he knew nothing. But he was certain that
he still knew enough to blow them both sky high. And what worried him most
was the fear that Control, or Bill, or Percy Alleline, or whoever had the final say
these days, would be too greedy, or too slow, to evacuate the networks by the
time Jim, under forms of duress he could only guess at, had no alternative but to
break completely.

“So that’s the joke,” said Jim, with no humour whatever. “They couldn’t have
cared less about the networks. They asked me half a dozen questions about
Aggravate, then lost interest. They knew damn well that Testify wasn’t my

private brain-child and they knew all about Control buying the Stevcek pass in
Vienna. They began exactly where I wanted to end: with the briefing in St.
James’s. They didn’t ask me about a legman; they weren’t interested in who had
driven me to the rendezvous with the Magyar. All they wanted to talk about was
Control’s rotten-apple theory.”

One word, thought Smiley again, it might be just one word. He said, “Did they
actually know the St. James’s address?”

“They knew the brand of the bloody sherry, man.”

“And the charts?” asked Smiley quickly. “The music case?”

“No.” He added, “Not at first. No.”

Thinking inside out, Steed-Asprey used to call it. They knew because the mole
Gerald had told them, thought Smiley. The mole knew what the housekeepers
had succeeded in getting out of old MacFadean. The Circus conducts its
postmortem: Karla has the benefit of its findings in time to use them on Jim.

“So I suppose by now you were beginning to think Control was right: there
was a mole,” said Smiley.

Jim and Smiley were leaning on a wooden gate. The ground sloped sharply away
from them in a long sweep of bracken and fields. Below them lay another
village, a bay, and a thin ribbon of moonlit sea.

“They went straight to the heart of it. 'Why did Control go it alone? What did
he hope to achieve?’ 'His come-back,’ I said. So they laugh: 'With tinpot
information about military emplacements in the area of Brno? That wouldn’t
even buy him a square meal in his club.’ 'Maybe he was losing his grip,’ I said.

If Control was losing his grip, they said, who was stamping on his fingers?
Alleline, I said, that was the buzz; Alleline and Control were in competition to
provide intelligence. But in Brixton we only got the rumours, I said. 'And what
is Alleline producing that Control is not producing?’ 'I don’t know.’ 'But you
just said that Alleline and Control are in competition to provide intelligence.’

'It’s rumour. I don’t know.’ Back to the cooler.”

Time, said Jim, at this stage lost him completely. He lived either in the
darkness of the hood, or in the white light of the cells. There was no night or day,
and to make it even more weird they kept the noises going most of the time.

They were working him on the production-line principle, he explained: no
sleep, relays of questions, a lot of disorientation, a lot of muscle, till the
interrogation became to him a slow race between going a bit dotty, as he called
it, and breaking completely. Naturally, he hoped he’d go dotty but that wasn’t
something you could decide for yourself, because they had a way of bringing
you back. A lot of the muscle was done electrically.

“So we start again. New tack. 'Stevcek was an important general. If he asked
for a senior British officer, he could expect him to be properly informed about all
aspects of his career. Are you telling us you did not inform yourself?’ 'I’m
saying I got my information from Control.’ 'Did you read Stevcek’s dossier at
the Circus?’ 'No.’ 'Did Control?’ 'I don’t know.’ 'What conclusions did Control
draw from Stevcek’s second appointment in Moscow? Did Control speak to you
about Stevcek’s role in the Warsaw Pact Liaison Committee?’ 'No.’ They stuck
to that question and I suppose I stuck to my answer, because after a few more
'no’s they got a bit crazy. They seemed to lose patience. When I passed out, they
hosed me down and had another crack.”

Movement, said Jim. His narrative had become oddly jerky. Cells, corridors,
car ... at the airport V.I.P. treatment and a mauling before the aeroplane ... on
the flight, dropped off to sleep and was punished for it. “Came round in a cell
again, smaller, no paint on the walls. Sometimes I thought I was in Russia. I
worked out by the stars that we had flown east. Sometimes I was in Sarratt, back
on the interrogation resistance course.”

For a couple of days they let him alone. Head was muzzy. He kept hearing the
shooting in the forest and he saw the tattoo again, and when finally the big
session started—the one he remembered as the marathon—he had the
disadvantage of feeling half defeated when he went in.

“Matter of health, much as anything,” he explained, very tense now.

“We could take a break if you want,” Smiley said, but where Jim was, there
were no breaks, and what he wanted was irrelevant.

That was the long one, Jim said. Sometime in the course of it, he told them
about Control’s notes and his charts and the coloured inks and crayons. They
were going at him like the devil and he remembered an all-male audience, at one
end of the room, peering like a lot of damn medicos and muttering to one
another, and he told them about the crayons just to keep the talk alive, to make
them stop and listen. They listened but they didn’t stop.

“Once they had the colours, they wanted to know what the colours meant.
'What did blue mean?’ 'Control didn’t have blue.’ 'What did red mean? What
did red stand for? Give us an example of red on the chart. What did red mean?
What did red mean? What did red mean?’ Then everybody clears out except a
couple of guards and one cold little fellow, stiff back, seemed to be head boy.

The guards take me over to a table, and this little fellow sits beside me like a
bloody gnome with his hands folded. He’s got two crayons in front of him, red
and green, and a chart of Stevcek’s career.”

It wasn’t that Jim broke exactly; he just ran out of invention. He couldn’t think
up any more stories. The truths that he had locked away so deeply were the only

things that suggested themselves.

“So you told him about the rotten apple,” Smiley suggested. “And you told
him about Tinker, Tailor.”

Yes, Jim agreed, he did. He told him that Control believed Stevcek could
identify a mole inside the Circus. He told him about the Tinker, Tailor code and
who each of them was, name by name.

“What was his reaction?”

“Thought for a bit, then offered me a cigarette. Hated the damn thing.”

“Why?”

“Tasted American. Camel, one of those.”

“Did he smoke one himself?”

Jim gave a short nod. “Bloody chimney,” he said.

Time, after that, began once more to flow, said Jim. He was taken to a camp,
he guessed outside a town, and lived in a compound of huts with a double
perimeter of wire. With the help of a guard, he was soon able to walk; one day
they even went for a stroll in the forest. The camp was very big; his own
compound was only a part of it. At night he could see the glow of a city to the
east. The guards wore denims and didn’t speak, so he still had no way of telling
whether he was in Czecho or in Russia, but his money was heavily on Russia,
and when the surgeon came to take a look at his back he used a Russian-English
interpreter to express his contempt for his predecessor’s handiwork. The
interrogation continued sporadically, but without hostility. They put a fresh team
on him but it was a leisurely crowd by comparison with the first eleven. One
night he was taken to a military airport and flown by R.A.F. fighter to Inverness.
From there he went by small plane to Elstree, then by van to Sarratt; both were
night journeys.

Jim was winding up fast. He was already launched on his experiences at the
Nursery, in fact, when Smiley asked, “And the headman, the little cold one: you
never saw him again?”

Once, Jim conceded; just before he left.

“What for?”

“Gossip.” Much louder. “Eot of damned tripe about Circus personalities,
matter of fact.”

“Which personalities?”

Jim ducked that question. Tripe about who was on the up staircase, he said,
who was on the down. Who was next in line for Chief: “ 'How should I know,’ I
said. 'Bloody janitors hear it before Brixton does.’ ”

“So who came in for the tripe, precisely?”

Mainly Roy Bland, said Jim sullenly. How did Bland reconcile his left-wing

leanings with his work at the Circus? He hasn’t got any left-wing leanings, said
Jim, that’s how. What was Bland’s standing with Esterhase and Adeline? What
did Bland think of Bill’s paintings? Then how much Roy drank and what would
become of him if Bill ever withdrew his support for him? Jim gave meagre
answers to these questions.

“Was anyone else mentioned?”

“Esterhase,” Jim snapped, in the same taut tone. “Bloody man wanted to know
how anyone could trust a Hungarian.”

Smiley’s next question seemed, even to himself, to cast an absolute silence
over the whole black valley.

“And what did he say about me?” He repeated: “What did he say about me?”

“Showed me a cigarette lighter. Said it was yours. Present from Ann. 'With all
my love.’ Her signature. Engraved.”

“Did he mention how he came by it? What did he say, Jim? Come on, I’m not
going to weaken at the knees just because some Russian hood made a bad joke
about me.”

Jim’s answer came out like an army order. “He reckoned that after Bill
Haydon’s fling with her, she might care to redraft the inscription.” He swung
away towards the car. “I told him,” he shouted furiously. “Told him to his
wrinkled little face. You can’t judge Bill by things like that. Artists have totally
different standards. See things we can’t see. Feel things that are beyond us.
Bloody little man just laughed. 'Didn’t know his pictures were that good,’ he
said. I told him, George. 'Go to hell. Go to bloody hell. If you had one Bill
Haydon in your damned outfit, you could call it set and match.’ I said to him:
'Christ Almighty,’ I said, 'what are you running over here? A service or the
bloody Salvation Army?’ ”

“That was well said,” Smiley remarked at last, as if commenting on some
distant debate. “And you’d never seen him before?”

“Who?”

“The little frosty chap. He wasn’t familiar to you—from long ago, for
instance? Well, you know how we are. We’re trained, we see a lot of faces,
photographs of Centre personalities, and sometimes they stick. Even if we can’t
put a name to them any more. This one didn’t, anyway. I just wondered. It
occurred to me you had a lot of time to think,” he went on, conversationally.

“You lay there recovering, waiting to come home, and what else had you to do,
but think?” He waited. “So what did you think of, I wonder? The mission. Your
mission, I suppose.”

“Off and on.”

“With what conclusions? Anything useful? Any suspicions, insights, any hints

for me to take away?”

“Damn all, thank you,” Jim snapped, very hard. “You know me, George
Smiley. I’m not a juju man. I’m a—”

“You’re a plain fieldman who lets the other chaps do his thinking.
Nevertheless, when you know you have been led into a king-sized trap, betrayed,
shot in the back, and have nothing to do for months but lie or sit on a bunk, or
pace a Russian cell, I would guess that even the most dedicated man of
action”—his voice had lost none of its friendliness—“might put his mind to
wondering how he landed in such a scrape. Let’s take Operation Testify a
minute,” Smiley suggested to the motionless figure before him. “Testify ended
Control’s career. He was disgraced and he couldn’t pursue his mole, assuming
there was one. The Circus passed into other hands. With a sense of timeliness.
Control died. Testify did something else, too. It revealed to the Russians—
through you, actually—the exact reach of Control’s suspicions. That he’d
narrowed the field to five, but apparently no further. I’m not suggesting you
should have fathomed all that for yourself in your cell, waiting. After all, you
had no idea, sitting in the pen, that Control had been thrown out—though it
might have occurred to you that the Russians laid on that mock battle in the
forest in order to raise a wind. Did it?”

“You’ve forgotten the networks,” said Jim dully.

“Oh, the Czechs had the networks marked down long before you came on the
scene. They only rolled them up in order to compound Control’s failure.”

The discursive, almost chatty tone with which Smiley threw out these theories
found no resonance in Jim. Having waited in vain for him to volunteer some
word, Smiley let the matter drop. “Well, let’s just go over your reception at
Sarratt, shall we? To wrap it up?”

In a rare moment of forgetfulness, he helped himself to the vodka bottle
before passing it to Jim.

To judge by his voice, Jim had had enough. He spoke fast and angrily, with
that same military shortness which was his refuge from intellectual incursions.

For four days Sarratt was limbo, he said: “Ate a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot.
Walked round the cricket ground.” He’d have swum, but the pool was under
repair, as it had been six months before: damned inefficient. He had a medical,
watched television in his hut, and played a bit of chess with Cranko, who was
running reception.

Meanwhile he waited for Control to show up, but he didn’t. The first person
from the Circus to visit him was the resettlement officer, talking about a friendly
teaching agency; next came some pay wallah to discuss his pension entitlement;
then the doctor again to assess him for a gratuity. He waited for the inquisitors to

appear but they never did, which was a relief because he didn’t know what he
would have told them until he had the green light from Control and he’d had
enough of questions. He guessed Control was holding them off. It seemed mad
that he should keep from the inquisitors what he had already told the Russians
and the Czechs, but until he heard from Control, what else could he do? When
Control still sent no word, he formed notions of presenting himself to Lacon and
telling his story. Then he decided that Control was waiting for him to get clear of
the Nursery before he contacted him. He had a relapse for a few days, and when
it was over Toby Esterhase turned up in a new suit, apparently to shake him by
the hand and wish him luck. But in fact to tell him how things stood.

“Bloody odd fellow to send, but he seemed to have come up in the world.
Then I remembered what Control said about only using chaps from outstations.”

Esterhase told him that the Circus had very nearly gone under as a result of
Testify and that Jim was currently the Circus’s Number One leper. Control was
out of the game and a reorganisation was going on in order to appease Whitehall.

“Then he told me not to worry,” said Jim.

“In what way not worry?”

“About my special brief. He said a few people knew the real story, and I
needn’t worry because it was being taken care of. All the facts were known.

Then he gave me a thousand quid in cash to add to my gratuity.”

“Who from?”

“He didn’t say.”

“Did he mention Control’s theory about Stevcek? Centre’s spy inside the
Circus?”

“The facts were known,” Jim repeated, glaring. “He ordered me not to
approach anyone or try to get my story heard, because it was all being taken care
of at the highest level and anything I did might spoil the kill. The Circus was
back on the road. I could forget Tinker, Tailor and the whole damn game—
moles, everything. 'Drop out,’ he said. 'You’re a lucky man, Jim,’ he kept
saying. 'You’ve been ordered to become a lotus-eater.’ I could forget it. Right?
Forget it. Just behave as if it had never happened.” He was shouting. “And that’s
what I’ve been doing: obeying orders and forgetting!”

The night landscape seemed to Smiley suddenly innocent; it was like a great
canvas on which nothing bad or cruel had ever been painted. Side by side, they
stared down the valley over the clusters of lights to a tor raised against the
horizon. A single tower stood at its top and for a moment it marked for Smiley
the end of the journey.

“Yes,” he said. “I did a bit of forgetting, too. So Toby actually mentioned
Tinker, Tailor to you. However did he get hold of that story, unless ... And no

word from Bill?” he went on. “Not even a postcard.”

“Bill was abroad,” said Jim shortly.

“Who told you that?”

“Toby.”

“So you never saw Bill; since Testify, your oldest, closest friend, he
disappeared.”

“You heard what Toby said. I was out of bounds. Quarantine.”

“Bill was never much of a one for regulations, though, was he?” said Smiley,
in a reminiscent tone.

“And you were never one to see him straight,” Jim barked.

“Sorry I wasn’t there when you called on me, before you left for Czecho,”
Smiley remarked after a small pause. “Control had pushed me over to Germany
to get me out of the light and when I came back—what was it that you wanted,
exactly?”

“Nothing. Thought Czecho might be a bit hairy. Thought I’d give you the nod,
say goodbye.”

“Before a mission?” cried Smiley in mild surprise. “Before such a special
mission?” Jim showed no sign that he had heard. “Did you give anyone else the
nod? I suppose we were all away. Toby, Roy—Bill; did he get one?”

“No one.”

“Bill was on leave, wasn’t he? But I gather he was around, all the same.”

“No one,” Jim insisted, as a spasm of pain caused him to lift his right shoulder
and rotate his head. “All out,” he said.

“That’s very unlike you, Jim,” said Smiley in the same mild tone, “to go round
shaking hands with people before you go on vital missions. You must have been
getting sentimental in your old age. It wasn’t...” he hesitated. “It wasn’t advice
or anything that you wanted, was it? After all, you did think the mission was
poppycock, didn’t you? And that Control was losing his grip. Perhaps you felt
you should take your problem to a third party? It all had rather a mad air, I
agree.”

Learn the facts, Steed-Asprey used to say, then try on the stories like clothes.

With Jim still locked in a furious silence, they returned to the car.

At the motel Smiley drew twenty postcard-sized photographs from the recesses
of his coat and laid them out in two lines across the ceramic table. Some were
snaps, some portraits; all were of men and none of them looked English. With a
grimace Jim picked out two and handed them to Smiley. He was sure of the first,
he muttered, less sure of the second. The first was the headman, the cool little
man. The second was one of the swine who watched from the shadows while the

thugs took Jim to pieces. Smiley returned the photographs to his pocket. As he
topped up their glasses for a nightcap, a less tortured observer than Jim might
have noticed a sense not of triumph but of ceremony about him; as though the
drink were putting a seal on something.

“So when was the last time you saw Bill, actually? To talk to,” Smiley asked,
just as one might about any old friend. He had evidently disturbed Jim in other
thoughts, for he took a moment to lift his head and catch the question.

“Oh, round about,” he said carelessly. “Bumped into him in the corridors, I
suppose.”

“And to talk to? Never mind.” For Jim had returned to his other thoughts.

Jim would not be driven all the way to school. Smiley had to drop him short,
at the top of the tarmac path that led through the graveyard to the church. He had
left some workbooks in the antechapel, he said. Momentarily, Smiley felt
disposed to disbelieve him, but could not understand why. Perhaps because he
had come to the opinion that after thirty years in the trade, Jim was still a rather
poor liar. The last Smiley saw of him was that lopsided shadow striding towards
the Norman porch as his heels cracked like gunshot between the tombs.

Smiley drove to Taunton and from the Castle Hotel made a string of telephone
calls. Though exhausted, he slept fitfully between visions of Karla sitting at
Jim’s table with two crayons, and Cultural Attache Polyakov alias Viktorov, fired
by concern for the safety of his mole Gerald, waiting impatiently in the
interrogation cell for Jim to break. Lastly of Toby Esterhase bobbing into Sarratt
in place of the absent Haydon, cheerfully advising Jim to forget all about Tinker,
Tailor, and his dead inventor. Control.

The same night, Peter Guillam drove west, clean across England to Liverpool,
with Ricki Tarr as his only passenger. It was a tedious journey in beastly
conditions. For most of it, Tarr boasted about the rewards he would claim, and
the promotion, once he had carried out his mission. From there he talked about
his women: Danny, her mother, Irina. He seemed to envisage a menage a quatre
in which the two women would jointly care for Danny, and for himself.

“There’s a lot of the mother in Irina. That’s what frustrates her, naturally.”
Boris, he said, could get lost; he would tell Karla to keep him. As their
destination approached, his mood changed again and he fell silent. The dawn
was cold and foggy. In the suburbs they had to drop to a crawl and cyclists
overtook them. A reek of soot and steel filled the car.

“Don’t hang about in Dublin, either,” said Guillam suddenly. “They expect
you to work the soft routes, so keep your head down. Take the first plane out.”

“We’ve been through all that.”

“Well, Fm going through it all again,” Guillam retorted. “What’s
Mackelvore’s workname?”

“For Christ’s sake,” Tarr breathed, and gave it.

It was still dark when the Irish ferry sailed. There were soldiers and police
everywhere: this war, the last, the one before. A fierce wind was blowing off the
sea and the going looked rough. At the dockside, a sense of fellowship briefly
touched the small crowd as the ship’s lights bobbed quickly into the gloom.
Somewhere a woman was crying, somewhere a drunk was celebrating his
release.

He drove back slowly, trying to work himself out: the new Guillam who starts
at sudden noises, has nightmares, and not only can’t keep his girl but makes up
crazy reasons for distrusting her. He had challenged Camilla about Sand, and the
hours she kept, and about her secrecy in general. After listening with her grave
brown eyes fixed on him, she told him he was a fool, and left. “I am what you
think I am,” she said, and fetched her things from the bedroom. From his empty
flat he telephoned Toby Esterhase, inviting him for a friendly chat later that day.

Smiley sat in the Minister’s Rolls, with Lacon beside him. In Ann’s family the
car was called the black bedpan, and hated for its flashiness. The chauffeur had
been sent to find himself breakfast. The Minister sat in the front and everyone
looked forward down the long bonnet, across the river to the foggy towers of
Battersea Power Station. The Minister’s hair was full at the back, and licked into
small black horns around the ears.

“If you’re right,” the Minister declared, after a funereal silence. “I’m not
saying you’re not, but if you are, how much porcelain will he break at the end of
the day?”

Smiley did not quite understand.

“I’m talking about scandal. Gerald gets to Moscow. Right, so then what
happens? Does he leap on a soap-box and laugh his head off in public about all
the people he’s made fools of over here? I mean, Christ, we’re all in this
together, aren’t we? I don’t see why we should let him go just so’s he can pull
the bloody roof down over our heads and the competition sweep the bloody
pool.”

He tried a different tack. “I mean to say, just because the Russians know our
secrets, doesn’t mean everyone else has to. We got plenty of other fish to fry
apart from them, don’t we? What about all the black men: are they going to be
reading the gory details in the Walla Walla News in a week’s time?”

Or his constituents, Smiley thought.

“I think that’s always been a point the Russians accept,” said Lacon. “After
all, if you make your enemy look a fool, you lose the justification for engaging
him.” He added, “They’ve never made use of their opportunities so far, have
they?”

“Well, make sure they toe the line. Get it in writing. No, don’t. But you tell
them what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. We don’t go round
publishing the batting order at Moscow Centre, so they can bloody well play
ball, too, for once.”

Declining a lift, Smiley said the walk would do him good.

It was Thursgood’s day for duty and he felt it badly. Headmasters, in his opinion,
should be above the menial tasks; they should keep their minds clear for policy
and leadership. The flourish of his Cambridge gown did not console him, and as
he stood in the gymnasium watching the boys file in for morning line-up, his eye

fixed on them balefully, if not with downright hostility. It was Marjoribanks,
though, who dealt the death-blow.

“He said it was his mother,” he explained, in a low murmur to Thursgood’s
left ear. “He’d had a telegram and proposed to leave at once. He wouldn’t even
stay for a cup of tea. I promised to pass on the message.”

“It’s monstrous, absolutely monstrous,” said Thursgood.

“I’ll take his French, if you like. We can double up Five and Six.”

“I’m furious,” said Thursgood. “I can’t think. I’m so furious.”

“And Irving says he’ll take the rugger final.”

“Reports to be written, exams, rugger finals to play off. What’s supposed to be
the matter with the woman? Just a flu, I suppose, a seasonal flu. Well, we’ve all
got that, so have our mothers. Where does she live?”

“I rather gathered from what he said to Sue that she was dying.”

“Well, that’s one excuse he won’t be able to use again,” said Thursgood, quite
unmollified, and with a sharp bark quelled the noise and read the roll.

“Roach?”

“Sick, sir.”

That was all he needed to fill his cup. The school’s richest boy having a
nervous breakdown about his wretched parents, and the father threatening to
remove him.

It was almost four o’clock on the afternoon of the same day. Safe houses 1 have
known, thought Guillam, looking round the gloomy flat. He could write of them
the way a commercial traveller could write about hotels: from your five-star hall
of mirrors in Belgravia, with Wedgwood pilasters and gilded oak leaves, to this
two-room scalp-hunters’ shakedown in Lexham Gardens, smelling of dust and
drains, with a three-foot fire extinguisher in the pitch-dark hall. Over the
fireplace, cavaliers drinking out of pewter. On the nest of tables, sea-shells for
ashtrays; and in the grey kitchen, anonymous instructions to “Be Sure and Turn
Off the Gas Both Gocks.” He was crossing the hall when the house bell rang,
exactly on time. He lifted the phone and heard Toby’s distorted voice howling in
the earpiece. He pressed the button and heard the clunk of the electric lock
echoing in the stairwell. He opened the front door but left it on the chain till he
was sure Toby was alone.

“How are we?” said Guillam cheerfully, letting him in.

“Fine, actually, Peter,” said Toby, pulling off his coat and gloves.

There was tea on a tray: Guillam had prepared it, two cups. To safe houses
belongs a certain standard of catering. Either you are pretending that you live
there or that you are adept anywhere; or simply that you think of everything. In
the trade, naturalness is an art, Guillam decided. That was something Gamilla
could not appreciate.

“Actually, it’s quite strange weather,” Esterhase announced, as if he had really
been analysing its qualities. Safe-house small-talk was never much better. “One
walks a few steps and is completely exhausted already. So we are expecting a
Pole?” he said, sitting down. “A Pole in the fur trade who you think might run
courier for us.”

“Due here any minute.”

“Do we know him? 1 had my people look up the name but they found no
trace.”

My people, thought Guillam: 1 must remember to use that one. “The Free
Poles made a pass at him a few months back and he ran a mile,” he said. “Then
Karl Stack spotted him round the warehouses and thought he might be useful to
the scalp-hunters.” He shrugged. “1 liked him but what’s the point? We can’t
even keep our own people busy.”

“Peter, you are very generous,” said Esterhase reverently, and Guillam had the
ridiculous feeling he had just tipped him. To his relief, the front doorbell rang

and Fawn took up his place in the doorway.

“Sorry about this, Toby,” Smiley said, a little out of breath from the stairs.
“Peter, where shall I hang my coat?”

Turning him to the wall, Guillam lifted Toby’s unresisting hands and put them
against it, then searched him for a gun, taking his time. Toby had none.

“Did he come alone?” Guillam asked. “Or is there some little friend waiting in
the road?”

“Looked all clear to me,” said Fawn.

Smiley was at the window, gazing down into the street. “Put the light out a
minute, will you?” he said.

“Wait in the hall,” Guillam ordered, and Fawn withdrew, carrying Smiley’s
coat. “Seen something?” he asked Smiley, joining him at the window.

Already the London afternoon had taken on the misty pinks and yellows of
evening. The square was Victorian residential; at the centre, a caged garden,
already dark. “Just a shadow, I suppose,” said Smiley with a grunt, and turned
back to Esterhase. The clock on the mantelpiece chimed four. Fawn must have
wound it up.

“I want to put a thesis to you, Toby. A notion about what’s going on. May I?”

Esterhase didn’t move an eyelash. His little hands rested on the wooden arms
of his chair. He sat quite comfortably, but slightly to attention, toes and heels of
his polished shoes together.

“You don’t have to speak at all. There’s no risk to listening, is there?”

“Maybe.”

“It’s two years ago. Percy Alleline wants Gontrol’s job, but he has no standing
in the Gircus. Gontrol has made sure of that. Gontrol is sick and past his prime
but Percy can’t dislodge him. Remember the time?”

Esterhase gave a neat nod.

“One of those silly seasons,” said Smiley, in his reasonable voice. “There isn’t
enough work outside so we start intriguing around the service, spying on one
another. Percy’s sitting in his room one morning with nothing to do. He has a
paper appointment as Operational Director, but in practice he’s a rubber stamp
between the regional sections and Gontrol, if that. Percy’s door opens and
somebody walks in. We’ll call him Gerald—it’s just a name. 'Percy,’ he says,
T’ve stumbled on a major Russian source. It could be a gold-mine.’ Or perhaps
he doesn’t say anything till they’re outside the building, because Gerald is very
much a fieldman; he doesn’t like to talk with walls and telephones around.
Perhaps they take a walk in the park or a drive in a car. Perhaps they eat a meal
somewhere, and at this stage there isn’t much Percy can do but listen. Percy’s

had very litde experience of the European scene, remember, least of all Czecho
or the Balkans. He cut his teeth in South America and after that he worked the
old possessions: India, the Middle East. He doesn’t know a lot about Russians or
Czechs or what you will; he’s inclined to see red as red and leave it at that.
Unfair?”

Esterhase pursed his lips and frowned a little, as if to say he never discussed a
superior.

“Whereas Gerald is an expert on those things. His operational life has been
spent weaving and ducking round the Eastern markets. Percy’s out of his depth
but keen. Gerald’s on his home ground. This Russian source, says Gerald, could
be the richest the Circus has had for years. Gerald doesn’t want to say too much
but he expects to be getting some trade samples in a day or two, and when he
does, he’d like Percy to run his eye over them just to get a notion of the quality.
They can go into source details later. 'But why me?’ says Percy. 'What’s it all
about?’ So Gerald tells him. 'Percy,’ he says, 'some of us in the regional sections
are worried sick by the level of operational losses. There seems to be a jinx
around. Too much loose talk inside the Circus and out. Too many people being
cut in on distribution. Out in the field, our agents are going to the wall, our
networks are being rolled up or worse, and every new ploy ends up a street
accident. We want you to help us put that right.’ Gerald is not mutinous, and he’s
careful not to suggest that there’s a traitor inside the Circus who’s blowing all the
operations, because you and I know that once talk like that gets around the
machinery grinds to a halt. Anyway the last thing Gerald wants is a witch-hunt.
But he does say that the place is leaking at the joints, and that slovenliness at the
top is leading to failures lower down. All balm to Percy’s ear. He lists the recent
scandals and he’s careful to lean on Alleline’s own Middle East adventure,
which went so wrong and nearly cost Percy his career. Then he makes his
proposal. This is what he says. In my thesis, you understand—it’s just a thesis.”

“Sure, George,” said Toby, and licked his lips.

“Another thesis would be that Alleline was his own Gerald, you see. It just
happens that I don’t believe it; I don’t believe Percy is capable of going out and
buying himself a top Russian spy and manning his own boat from then on. I
think he’d mess it up.”

“Sure,” said Esterhase, with absolute confidence.

“So this, in my thesis, is what Gerald says to Percy next. 'We—that is, myself
and those like-minded souls who are associated with this project—would like
you to act as our father figure, Percy. We’re not political men, we’re operators.
We don’t understand the Whitehall jungle. But you do. You handle the
committees, we’ll handle Merlin. If you act as our cut-out, and protect us from

the rot that’s set in, which means in effect limiting knowledge of the operation to
the absolute minimum, we’ll supply the goods.’ They talk over ways and means
in which this might be done; then Gerald leaves Percy to fret for a bit. A week, a
month, I don’t know. Long enough for Percy to have done his thinking. One day
Gerald produces the first sample. And of course it’s very good. Very, very good.
Naval stuff, as it happens, which couldn’t suit Percy better, because he’s very
well in at the Admiralty; it’s his supporters’ club. So Percy gives his naval
friends a sneak preview and they water at the mouth. 'Where does it come from?
Will there be more?’ There’s plenty more. As to the identity of the source—well,
that’s a big big mystery at this stage, but so it should be. Forgive me if I’m a
little wide of the mark here and there, but I’ve only the file to go by.”

The mention of a file, the first indication that Smiley might be acting in some
official capacity, produced in Esterhase a discernible response. The habitual
licking of the lips was accompanied by a forward movement of the head and an
expression of shrewd familiarity, as if Toby by all these signals was trying to
indicate that he, too, had read the file, whatever file it was, and entirely shared
Smiley’s conclusions. Smiley had broken off to drink some tea.

“More for you, Toby?” he asked over his cup.

“I’ll get it,” said Guillam with more firmness than hospitality.

“Tea, Fawn,” he called through the door. It opened at once and Fawn appeared
on the threshold, cup in hand.

Smiley was back at the window. He had parted the curtain an inch, and was
staring into the square.

“Toby?”

“Yes, George?”

“Did you bring a baby-sitter?”

“No.”

“No one?”

“George, why should I bring baby-sitters if I am just going to meet Peter and a
poor Pole?”

Smiley returned to his chair. “Merlin as a source,” he resumed. “Where was I?
Yes, well, conveniently Merlin wasn’t just one source, was he, as little by little
Gerald explained to Percy and the two others he had by now drawn into the
magic circle. Merlin was a Soviet agent, all right, but, rather like Alleline, he
was also the spokesman of a dissident group. We love to see ourselves in other
people’s situations, and I’m sure Percy warmed to Merlin from the start. This
group, this caucus of which Merlin was the leader, was made up of, say, half a
dozen like-minded Soviet officials, each in his way well-placed. With time, I
suspect, Gerald gave his lieutenants, and Percy, a pretty close picture of these

sub-sources, but I don’t know. Merlin’s job was to collate their intelligence and
get it to the West, and over the next few months he showed remarkable
versatility in doing just that. He used all manner of methods, and the Circus was
only too willing to feed him the equipment. Secret writing, microdots stuck over
full stops on innocent-looking letters, dead letter-boxes in Western capitals, filled
by God knows what brave Russian, and dutifully cleared by Toby Esterhase’s
brave lamplighters. Live meetings, even, arranged and watched over by Toby’s
baby-sitters”—a minute pause as Smiley glanced again towards the window—“a
couple of drops in Moscow that had to be fielded by the local residency, though
they were never allowed to know their benefactor. But no clandestine radio;
Merlin doesn’t care for it. There was a proposal once—it even got as far as the
Treasury—to set up a permanent long-arm radio station in Finland, just to
service him, but it all foundered when Merlin said, 'Not on your nelly.’ He must
have been taking lessons from Karla, mustn’t he? You know how Karla hates
radio. The great thing is. Merlin has mobility: that’s his biggest talent. Perhaps
he’s in the Moscow Trade Ministry and can use the travelling salesmen. Anyway,
he has the resources and he has the leads out of Russia. And that’s why his
fellow conspirators look to him to deal with Gerald and agree to the terms, the
financial terms. Because they do want money. Lots of money. I should have
mentioned that. In that respect, secret services and their customers are like
anyone else. I’m afraid. They value most what costs most, and Merlin costs a
fortune. Ever bought a fake picture?”

“I sold a couple once,” said Toby with a flashy, nervous smile, but no one
laughed.

“The more you pay for it, the less inclined you are to doubt it. Silly, but there
we are. It’s also comforting for everyone to know that Merlin is venal. That’s a
motive we all understand—right, Toby? Specially in the Treasury. Twenty
thousand francs a month into a Swiss bank: well, there’s no knowing who
wouldn’t bend a few egalitarian principles for money like that. So Whitehall
pays him a fortune, and calls his intelligence priceless. And some of it is good,”
Smiley conceded. “Very good, I do think, and so it should be. Then, one day,
Gerald admits Percy to the greatest secret of all. The Merlin caucus has a
London end. It’s the start, I should tell you now, of a very, very clever knot.”

Toby put down his cup and with his handkerchief primly dabbed the corners
of his mouth.

“According to Gerald, a member of the Soviet Embassy here in London is
actually ready and able to act as Merlin’s London representative. He is even in
the extraordinary position of being able to use, on rare occasions, the Embassy
facilities to talk to Merlin in Moscow, to send and receive messages. And if

every imaginable precaution is taken, it is even possible now and then for Gerald
to arrange clandestine meetings with this wonder-man, to brief and debrief him,
to put follow-up questions and receive answers from Merlin almost by return of
post. We’ll call this Soviet official Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, and we’ll
pretend he’s a member of the cultural section of the Soviet Embassy. Are you
with me?”

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Esterhase. “I gone deaf.”

“The story is, he’s been a member of the London Embassy quite a while—
nine years, to be precise—but Merlin’s only recently added him to the flock.
While Polyakov was on leave in Moscow, perhaps?”

“I’m not hearing nothing.”

“Very quickly Polyakov becomes important, because before long Gerald
appoints him linchpin of the Witchcraft operation and a lot more besides. The
dead drops in Amsterdam and Paris, the secret inks, the microdots—they all go
on, all right, but at less of a pitch. The convenience of having Polyakov right on
the doorstep is too good to miss. Some of Merlin’s best material is smuggled to
London by diplomatic bag; all Polyakov has to do is slit open the envelopes and
pass them to his counterpart in the Gircus—Gerald or whomever Gerald
nominates. But we must never forget that this part of the Merlin operation is
deathly, deathly secret. The Witchcraft committee itself is, of course, secret, too,
but large. That’s inevitable. The operation is large, the take is large; processing
and distribution alone require a mass of clerical supervision—transcribers,
translators, codists, typists, evaluators, and God knows what. None of that
worries Gerald at all, of course: he likes it, in fact, because the art of being
Gerald is to be one of a crowd. Is the Witchcraft committee led from below?
From the middle or from the top? I rather like Karla’s description of committees,
don’t you? Is it Ghinese? A committee is an animal with four back legs.

“But the London end—Polyakov’s leg—that part is confined to the original
magic circle. Skordeno, de Silsky, all the pack: they can tear off abroad and devil
like mad for Merlin away from home. But here in London, the operation
involving Brother Polyakov, the way that knot is tied—that’s a very special
secret, for very special reasons. You, Percy, Bill Haydon, and Roy Bland. You
four are the magic circle. Right? Now let’s just speculate about how it works, in
detail. There’s a house, we know that. All the same, meetings there are very
elaborately arranged; we can be sure of that, can’t we? Who meets him, Toby?
Who has the handling of Polyakov? You? Roy? Bill?”

Taking the fat end of his tie, Smiley turned the silk lining outwards and
polished his glasses. “Everyone does,” he said, answering his own question.
“How’s that? Sometimes Percy meets him. I would guess Percy represents the

authoritarian side with him: 'Isn’t it time you took a holiday? Have you heard
from your wife this week?’ Percy would be good at that. But the Witchcraft
committee uses Percy sparingly. Percy’s the big gun and he must have rarity
value. Then there’s Bill Haydon; Bill meets him. That would happen more often,
I think. Bill’s impressive on Russia and he has entertainment value. I have a
feeling that he and Polyakov would hit it off pretty well. I would think Bill shone
when it came to the briefing and the follow-up questions, wouldn’t you? Making
certain that the right messages went to Moscow? Sometimes he takes Roy Bland
with him, sometimes he sends Roy on his own. I expect that’s something they
work out between themselves. And Roy, of course, is an economic expert, as
well as top man on satellites, so there’ll be lots to talk about in that department
also. And sometimes—I imagine birthdays, Toby, or a Christmas, or special
presentations of thanks and money—there’s a small fortune written down to
entertainment, I notice, let alone bounties. Sometimes, to make the party go, you
all four trot along, and raise your glasses to the king across the water: to Merlin,
through his envoy, Polyakov. Finally, I suppose, Toby himself has things to talk
to friend Polyakov about. There’s tradecraft to discuss; there are the useful
snippets about goings on inside the Embassy, which are so handy to the
lamplighters in their bread-and-butter surveillance operations against the
residency. So Toby also has his solo sessions. After all, we shouldn’t overlook
Polyakov’s local potential, quite apart from his role as Merlin’s London
representative. It’s not every day we have a tame Soviet diplomat in London
eating out of our hands. A little training with a camera and Polyakov could be
very useful just at the straight domestic level. Provided we all remember our
priorities.”

His gaze had not left Toby’s face. “I can imagine that Polyakov might run to
quite a few reels of film, can’t you? And that one of the jobs of whoever was
seeing him might be to replenish his stock: take him little sealed packets. Packets
of film. Unexposed film, of course, since it came from the Circus. Tell me, Toby
—could you, please—is the name Lapin familiar to you?”

A lick, a frown, a smile, a forward movement of the head: “Sure, George, I
know Lapin.”

“Who ordered the lamplighter reports on Lapin destroyed?”

“I did, George.”

“On your own initiative?”

The smile broadened a fraction. “Listen, George, I made some rungs up the
ladder these days.”

“Who said Connie Sachs had to be pushed downhill?”

“Look, I think it was Percy—okay? Say it was Percy, maybe Bill. You know

how it is in a big operation. Shoes to mend, pots to clean, always a thing going.”
He shrugged. “Maybe it was Roy, huh?”

“So you take orders from all of them,” said Smiley lightly. “That’s very
indiscriminate of you, Toby. You should know better.”

Esterhase didn’t like that at all.

“Who told you to cool off Max, Toby? Was it the same three people? Only I
have to report all this to Lacon, you see. He’s being awfully pressing just at the
moment. He seems to have the Minister on his back. Who was it?”

“George, you been talking to the wrong guys.”

“One of us has,” Smiley agreed pleasantly. “That’s for sure. They also want to
know about Westerby: just who put the muzzle on him. Was it the same person
who sent you down to Sarratt with a thousand quid in cash and a brief to put Jim
Prideaux’s mind at rest? It’s only facts I’m after, Toby, not scalps. You know me
—I’m not the vindictive sort. Anyway, what’s to say you’re not a very loyal
fellow? It’s just a question of who to.” He added, “Only they do badly want to
know, you see. There’s even some ugly talk of calling in the competition.

Nobody wants that, do they? It’s like going to solicitors when you’ve had a row
with your wife: an irrevocable step. Who gave you the message for Jim about
Tinker, Tailor? Did you know what it meant? Did you have it straight from
Polyakov, was that it?”

“For God’s sake,” Guillam whispered, “let me sweat the bastard.”

Smiley ignored him. “Let’s keep talking about Lapin. What was his job over
here?”

“He worked for Polyakov.”

“His secretary in the cultural department?”

“His legman.”

“But, my dear Toby, what on earth is a cultural attache doing with his own
legman?”

Esterhase’s eyes were on Smiley all the time. He’s like a dog, thought
Guillam; he doesn’t know whether to expect a kick or a bone. They flickered
from Smiley’s face to his hands, then back to his face, constantly checking the
telltale places.

“Don’t be damn silly, George,” Toby said carelessly. “Polyakov is working for
Moscow Gentre. You know that as well as I do.” He crossed his little legs and,
with a resurgence of all his former insolence, sat back in his chair and took a sip
of cold tea.

Whereas Smiley, to Guillam’s eye, appeared momentarily set back; from
which Guillam in his confusion dryly inferred that he was doubtless very pleased
with himself. Perhaps because Toby was at last doing the talking.

“Come on, George,” Toby said. “You’re not a child. Think how many
operations we ran this way. We buy Polyakov, okay? Polyakov’s a Moscow hood
but he’s our Joe. But he’s got to pretend to his own people that he’s spying on us.
How else does he get away with it? How does he walk in and out of that house
all day, no gorillas, no baby-sitters, everything so easy? He comes down to our
shop, so he got to take home the goodies. So we give him goodies. Chicken-feed,
so he can pass it home and everyone in Moscow claps him on the back and tells
him he’s a big guy—happens every day.”

If Guillam’s head by now was reeling with a kind of furious awe, Smiley’s
seemed remarkably clear.

“And that’s pretty much the standard story, is it, among the four initiated?”

“Well, standard I wouldn’t know,” said Esterhase, with a very Hungarian
movement of the hand, a spreading of the palm and a tilting either way.

“So who is Polyakov’s agent?”

The question, Guillam saw, mattered very much to Smiley: he had played the
whole long hand in order to arrive at it. As Guillam waited, his eyes now on
Esterhase, who was by no means so confident any more, now on Smiley’s
mandarin face, he realised that he, too, was beginning to understand the shape of
Karla’s last clever knot, as Smiley had called it—and of his own gruelling
interview with Alleline.

“What I’m asking you is very simple,” Smiley insisted. “Notionally, who is
Polyakov’s agent inside the Circus? Good heavens, Toby, don’t be obtuse. If
Polyakov’s cover for meeting you people is that he is spying on the Circus, then
he must have a Circus spy, mustn’t he? So who is he? He can’t come back to the
Embassy after a meeting with you people, loaded with reels of Circus chicken-
feed, and say, T got this from the boys.’ There has to be a story—and a good
one, at that: a whole history of courtship, recruitment, clandestine meetings,
money, and motive. Doesn’t there? Heavens, this isn’t just Polyakov’s cover
story: it’s his life-line. It’s got to be thorough. It’s got to be convincing; I’d say it
was a very big issue in the game. So who is he?” Smiley enquired pleasantly.
“You? Toby Esterhase masquerades as a Circus traitor in order to keep Polyakov
in business? My hat, Toby, that’s worth a whole handful of medals.”

They waited while Toby thought.

“You’re on a damn long road, George,” Toby said at last. “What happens you
don’t reach the other end?”

“Even with Eacon behind me?”

“You bring Eacon here. Percy, too; Bill. Why you come to the little guy? Go
to the big ones, pick on them.”

“I thought you were a big guy these days. You’d be a good choice for the part.

Toby. Hungarian ancestry, resentment about promotion, reasonable access but
not too much ... quick-witted, likes money ... With you as his agent, Polyakov
would have a cover story that really sits up and works. The big three give you
the chicken-feed, you hand it to Polyakov, Centre thinks Toby is all theirs,
everyone’s served, everyone’s content. The only problem arises when it
transpires that you’ve been handing Polyakov the crown jewels and getting
Russian chicken-feed in return. If that should turn out to be the case, you’re
going to need pretty good friends. Like us. That’s how my thesis runs—^just to
complete it. That Gerald is a Russian mole, run by Karla. And he’s pulled the
Circus inside out.”

Esterhase looked slightly ill. “George, listen. If you’re wrong, I don’t want to
be wrong too, get me?”

“But if he’s right, you want to be right,” Guillam suggested, in a rare
interruption. “And the sooner you’re right, the happier you’ll be.”

“Sure,” said Toby, quite unaware of any irony. “Sure. I mean George got a
nice idea, but Jesus, there’s two sides to everyone, George, agents specially, and
maybe it’s you who got the wrong one. Listen: who ever called Witchcraft
chicken-feed? No one. Never. It’s the best. You get one guy with a big mouth
starts shouting the dirt, and you dug up half London already. Get me? Look, I do
what they tell me. Okay? They say act the stooge for Polyakov, I act him. Pass
him this film, I pass it. I’m in a very dangerous situation,” he explained. “For
me, very dangerous indeed.”

“I’m sorry about that,” said Smiley at the window, where through a chink in
the curtain he was once more studying the square. “Must be worrying for you.”

“Extremely,” Toby agreed. “I get ulcers, can’t eat. Very bad predicament.”

For a moment, to Guillam’s fury, they were all three joined in a sympathetic
silence over Toby Esterhase’s bad predicament.

“Toby, you wouldn’t be lying about those baby-sitters, would you?” Smiley
enquired, still from the window.

“George, I cross my heart, I swear you.”

“What would you use for a job like this? Cars?”

“Pavement artists. Put a bus back by the air terminal, walk them through, turn
’em over.”

“How many?”

“Eight, ten. This time of year—six, maybe. We get a lot ill. Christmas,” he
said morosely.

“And one man alone?”

“Never. You crazy. One man! You think I run a toffee shop these days?”

Leaving the window, Smiley sat down again.

“Listen, George, that’s a terrible idea you got there, you know that? I’m a
patriotic fellow. Jesus,” Toby repeated.

“What is Polyakov’s job in the London residency?” Smiley asked.

“Polly works solo.”

“Running his master spy inside the Circus?”

“Sure. They take him off regular work, give him a free hand so’s he can
handle Toby, master spy. We work it all out; hours on end I sit with him. 'Listen,’
I say. 'Bill is suspecting me, my wife is suspecting me, my kid got measles, and I
can’t pay the doctor.’ All the crap that agents give you, I give it to Polly so’s he
can pass it home for real.”

“And who’s Merlin?”

Esterhase shook his head.

“But at least you’ve heard he’s based in Moscow,” Smiley said. “And a
member of the Soviet intelligence establishment, whatever else he isn’t?”

“That much they tell me,” Esterhase agreed.

“Which is how Polyakov can communicate with him. In the Circus’s interest,
of course. Secretly, without his own people becoming suspicious?”

“Sure.” Toby resumed his lament, but Smiley seemed to be listening to sounds
that were not in the room.

“And Tinker, Tailor?”

“I don’t know what the hell it is. I do what Percy tells me.”

“And Percy told you to square Jim Prideaux?”

“Sure. Maybe it was Bill. Or Roy, maybe. Listen, it was Roy. I got to eat,
George, understand? I don’t cut my throat two ways, follow me?”

“It is the perfect fix; you see that, don’t you, Toby, really?” Smiley remarked
in a quiet, rather distant way. “Assuming it is a fix. It makes everyone wrong
who’s right: Connie Sachs, Jerry Westerby . . . Jim Prideaux . . . even Control.
Silences the doubters before they’ve even spoken out... The permutations are
infinite, once you’ve brought off the basic lie. Moscow Centre must be allowed
to think she has an important Circus source; Whitehall on no account must get
wind of the same notion. Take it to its logical conclusion and Gerald would have
us strangling our own children in their beds. It would be beautiful in another
context,” he remarked almost dreamily. “Poor Toby; yes, I do see. What a time
you must have been having, running between them all.”

Toby had his next speech ready: “Naturally, if there is anything I can do of a
practical nature, you know me, George, I am always pleased to help—no trouble.
My boys are pretty well trained; you want to borrow them, maybe we can work a
deal. Naturally, I have to speak to Lacon first. All I want, I want to get this thing
cleared up. For the sake of the Circus, you know. That’s all I want. The good of

the firm. I’m a modest man; I don’t want anything for myself—okay?”

“Where’s this safe house you keep exclusively for Polyakov?”

“Five Lock Gardens, Camden Town.”

“With a caretaker?”

“Mrs. McCraig.”

“Lately a listener?”

“Sure.”

“Is there built-in audio?”

“What do you think?”

“So Millie McCraig keeps house and mans the recording instruments.”

She did, said Toby, ducking his head with great alertness.

“In a minute, I want you to telephone her and tell her I’m staying the night
and I’ll want to use the equipment. Tell her I’ve been called in on a special job
and she’s to do whatever I ask. I’ll be round about nine. What’s the procedure for
contacting Polyakov if you want a crash meeting?”

“My boys have a room on Haverstock Hill. Polly drives past the window each
morning on the way to the Embassy, each night going home. If they put up a
yellow poster protesting against traffic, that’s the signal.”

“And at night? At weekends?”

“Wrong-number phone call. But nobody likes that.”

“Has it ever been used?”

“I don’t know.”

“You mean you don’t listen to his phone?”

No answer.

“I want you to take the weekend off. Would that raise eyebrows at the
Circus?” Enthusiastically, Esterhase shook his head. “I’m sure you’d prefer to be
out of it, anyway, wouldn’t you?” Esterhase nodded. “Say you’re having girl
trouble or whatever sort of trouble you’re in these days. You’ll be spending the
night here, possibly two. Fawn will look after you; there’s food in the kitchen.
What about your wife?”

While Guillam and Smiley looked on, Esterhase dialled the Circus and asked
for Phil Porteous. He said his lines perfectly: a little self-pity, a little conspiracy,
a little joke. Some girl who was passionate about him up north, Phil, and
threatening wild things if he didn’t go and hold her hand.

“Don’t tell me, I know it happens to you every day, Phil. Hey, how’s that
gorgeous new secretary of yours? And listen, Phil, if Mara phones from home,
tell her Toby’s on a big job, okay? Blowing up the Kremlin, back on Monday.
Make it nice and heavy, huh? Cheers, Phil.”

He rang off and dialled a number in north London. “Mrs. M., hullo, this is

your favourite boyfriend—recognise the voice? Good. Listen, I’m sending you a
visitor tonight—an old, old friend, you’ll be surprised. She hates me,” he
explained to them, his hand over the mouthpiece. “He wants to check the
wiring,” he went on. “Look it all over, make sure it’s working okay, no bad leaks
—all right?”

“If he’s any trouble,” Guillam said to Fawn with real venom as they left, “bind
him hand and foot.”

In the stairwell, Smiley lightly touched his arm. “Peter, I want you to watch
my back. Will you do that for me? Give me a couple of minutes, then pick me up
on the corner of Marloes Road, heading north. Stick to the west pavement.”

Guillam waited, then stepped into the street. A thin drizzle lay on the air, which
had an eerie warmness like a thaw. Where lights shone, the moisture shifted in
fine clouds, but in shadow he neither saw nor felt it: simply, a mist blurred his
vision, making him half close his eyes. He completed one round of the gardens,
then entered a pretty mews well south of the pick-up point. Reaching Marloes
Road, he crossed to the west pavement, bought an evening paper, and began
walking at a leisurely rate past villas set in deep gardens. He was counting off
pedestrians, cyclists, cars, while out ahead of him, steadily plodding the far
pavement, he picked out George Smiley, the very prototype of the homegoing
Londoner. “Is it a team?” Guillam had asked. Smiley could not be specific.
“Short of Abingdon Villas, I’ll cross over,” he said. “Look for a solo. But look!”

As Guillam watched Smiley pulled up abruptly, as if he had just remembered
something, stepped perilously into the road, and scuttled between the angry
traffic to disappear at once through the doors of a liquor store. As he did so,
Guillam saw, or thought he saw, a tall crooked figure in a dark coat step out after
him, but at that moment a bus drew up, screening both Smiley and his pursuer;
and when it pulled away, it must have taken his pursuer with it, for the only
survivor on that strip of pavement was an older man in a black plastic raincoat
and cloth cap lolling at the bus stop while he read his evening paper; and when
Smiley emerged from the store with his brown bag, the man did not so much as
lift his head from the sporting pages. For a short while longer, Guillam trailed
Smiley through the smarter reaches of Victorian Kensington as he slipped from
one quiet square to another, sauntered into a mews and out again by the same
route. Only once, when Guillam forgot Smiley and out of instinct turned upon
his own tracks, did he have a suspicion of a third figure walking with them: a
fanged shadow thrown against the broadloom brickwork of an empty street, but
when he started forward, it was gone.

The night had its own madness after that; events ran too quickly for him to

fasten on them singly. Not till days afterwards did he realise that the figure, or
the shadow of it, had struck a chord of familiarity in his memory. Even then, for
some time, he could not place it. Then one early morning, waking abruptly, he
had it clear in his mind: a barking, military voice, a gentleness of manner heavily
concealed, a squash racket jammed behind the safe of his room in Brixton,
which brought tears to the eyes of his unemotional secretary.

Probably the only thing which Steve Mackelvore did wrong that same evening,
in terms of classic tradecraft, was blame himself for leaving the passenger door
of his car unlocked. Climbing in from the driver’s side, he put it down to his own
negligence that the other lock was up. Survival, as Jim Prideaux liked to recall,
is an infinite capacity for suspicion. By that purist standard, Mackelvore should
have suspected that in the middle of a particularly vile rush-hour, on a
particularly vile evening, in one of those blaring side streets that feed into the
lower end of the Elysees, Ricki Tarr would unlock the passenger door and hold
him up at gunpoint. But life in the Paris residency these days did little to keep a
man’s wits sharp, and most of Mackelvore’s working day had been taken up with
filing his weekly expenses and completing his weekly returns of staff for the
housekeepers. Only lunch, a longish affair with an insincere anglophile in the
French security labyrinth, had broken the monotony of that Friday.

His car, parked under a lime tree that was dying of exhaust fumes, had an
extraterritorial registration and “C.C.” plastered on the back, for the residency
cover was consular, though no one took it seriously. Mackelvore was a Circus
elder, a squat, white-haired Yorkshireman with a long record of consular
appointments which in the eyes of the world had brought him no advancement.
Paris was the last of them. He did not care particularly for Paris, and he knew
from an operational lifetime in the Far East that the French were not for him. But
as a prelude to retirement it could not be bettered. The allowances were good,
the billet was comfortable, and the most that had been asked of him in the ten
months he had been here was to welfare the occasional agent in transit, put up a
chalk-mark here and there, play postman to some ploy by Fondon Station, and
show a time to the visiting firemen.

Until now, that was, as he sat in his own car with Tarr’s gun jammed against
his rib-cage, and Tarr’s hand resting affectionately on his right shoulder, ready to
wrench his head off if he tried any monkey business. A couple of feet away, girls
hurried past on their way to the Metro, and six feet beyond that the traffic had
come to a standstill; it could stay that way for an hour. None was faintly stirred
by the sight of two men having a cosy chat in a parked car.

Tarr had been talking ever since Mackelvore sat down. He needed to send a
message to Alleline, he said. It would be personal and decypher yourself, and
Tarr would like Steve to work the machine for him while Tarr stood off with the
gun.

“What the hell have you been up to, Ricki?” Mackelvore complained, as they
walked arm in arm back to the residency. “The whole service is looking for you
—you know that, don’t you? They’ll skin you alive if they find you. We’re
supposed to do blood-curdling things to you on sight.”

He thought of turning into the hold and smacking Tarr’s neck, but he knew he
hadn’t the speed and Tarr would kill him.

The message would run to about two hundred groups, said Tarr, as
Mackelvore unlocked the front door and put on the lights. When Steve had
transmitted them, they would sit on the machine and wait for Percy’s answer. By
tomorrow, if Tarr’s instinct was correct, Percy would be coming over to Paris
hotfoot to have a conference with Ricki. This conference would also take place
in the residency, because Tarr reckoned it was marginally less likely that the
Russians would try to kill him on British consular premises.

“You’re berserk, Ricki. It’s not the Russians who want to kill you. It’s us.”

The front room was called Reception; it was what remained of the cover. It
had an old wooden counter and out-of-date “Notices to British Subjects”
hanging on the grimy wall. Here, with his left hand, Tarr searched Mackelvore
for a weapon but found none. It was a courtyard house and most of the sensitive
stuff was across the yard: the cypher-room, the strong-room, and the machines.

“You’re out of your mind, Ricki,” Mackelvore warned monotonously, as he
led the way through a couple of empty offices and pressed the bell to the cypher-
room. “You always thought you were Napoleon Bonaparte and now it’s got you
completely. You’d too much religion from your dad.”

The steel message hatch slid back and a mystified, slightly silly face appeared
in the opening. “You can go home, Ben, boy. Go home to your missus but stay
close to your phone in case I need you, there’s a lad. Leave the books where they
are and put the keys in the machines. I’ll be talking to London presently, under
my own steam.”

The face withdrew and they waited while the boy unlocked the door from
inside: one key, two keys, a spring lock.

“This gentleman’s from out East, Ben,” Mackelvore explained as the door
opened. “He’s one of my most distinguished connections.”

“Hullo, sir,” said Ben. He was a tall, mathematical-looking boy with
spectacles and an unblinking gaze.

“Get along with you, Ben. I’ll not dock it against your duty pay. You’ve the
weekend free on full rates, and you’ll not owe me time, either. Off you go, then.”

“Ben stays here,” said Tarr.

In Gambridge Gircus the lighting was quite yellow and from where Mendel

stood, on the third floor of the clothes shop, the wet tarmac glistened like cheap
gold. It was nearly midnight and he had been standing three hours. He stood
between a net curtain and a clothes-horse. He stood the way coppers stand the
world over: weight on both feet equally, legs straight, leaning slightly backward
over the line of balance. He had pulled his hat low and turned up his collar to
keep the white of his face from the street, but his eyes as they watched the front
entrance below him glittered like a cat’s eyes in a coal-hole. He would wait
another three hours or another six: Mendel was back on the beat; the scent of the
hunt was in his nostrils. Better still, he was a night bird; the darkness of that
fitting room woke him wonderfully. Such light as reached him from the street lay
upside down in pale pieces on the ceiling. All the rest—the cutting-benches, the
bolts of cloth, the draped machines, the steam iron, the signed photographs of
princes of the blood—these were there because he had seen them on his
reconnaissance that afternoon; the light did not reach them and even now he
could barely make them out.

From his window he covered most of the approaches: eight or nine unequal
roads and alleys that for no good reason had chosen Cambridge Circus as their
meeting point. Between them, the buildings were gimcrack, cheaply fitted out
with bits of Empire: a Roman bank, a theatre like a vast desecrated mosque.
Behind them, high-rise blocks advanced like an army of robots. Above, a pink
sky was slowly filling with fog.

Why was it so quiet? he wondered. The theatre had long emptied but why
didn’t the pleasure trade of Soho, only a stone’s throw from his window, fill the
place with taxis, groups of loiterers? Not a single fruit lorry had rumbled down
Shaftesbury Avenue on its way to Covent Garden.

Through his binoculars Mendel once more studied the building straight across
the road from him. It seemed to sleep even more soundly than its neighbours.

The twin doors of the portico were closed and no light was visible in the ground-
floor windows. Only on the fourth floor, out of the second window from the left,
a pale glow issued, and Mendel knew it was the duty officer’s room; Smiley had
told him. Briefly he raised the glasses to the roof, where a plantation of aerials
made wild patterns against the sky, then down a floor to the four blackened
windows of the radio section.

“At night everyone uses the front door,” Guillam had said. “It’s an economy
measure to cut down on janitors.”

In those three hours, only three events had rewarded Mendel’s vigil; one an
hour is not much. At half past nine a blue Ford Transit delivered two men
carrying what looked like an ammunition box. They unlocked the door for
themselves and closed it as soon as they were inside, while Mendel murmured

his commentary into the telephone. At ten o’clock the shuttle arrived; Guillam
had warned him of this, too. The shuttle collected hot documents from the
outstations and stored them for safekeeping at the Circus over the weekend. It
called at Brixton, Acton, and Sarratt, in that order, said Guillam, lastly at the
Admiralty, and it made the Circus by about ten. In the event, it arrived on the dot
of ten, and this time two men from inside the building came out to help unload;
Mendel reported that, too, and Smiley acknowledged with a patient “Thank
you.”

Was Smiley sitting down? Was he in the darkness like Mendel? Mendel had a
notion he was. Of all the odd coves he had known, Smiley was the oddest. You
thought, to look at him, that he couldn’t cross the road alone, but you might as
well have offered protection to a hedgehog. Funnies, Mendel mused. A lifetime
of chasing villains and how do I end up? Breaking and entering, standing in the
dark and spying on the Funnies. He’d never held with Funnies till he met Smiley.
Thought they were an interfering lot of amateurs and college boys; thought they
were unconstitutional; thought the best thing the Special Branch could do, for its
own sake and the public’s, was say “Yes, sir,” “No, sir” and lose the
correspondence. Come to think of it, with the notable exception of Smiley and
Guillam, that’s exactly what he thought tonight.

Shortly before eleven, just an hour ago, a cab arrived. A plain licensed London
hackney cab, and it drew up at the theatre. Even that was something Smiley had
warned him about: it was the habit within the service not to take taxis to the
door. Some stopped at Foyle’s, some in Old Compton Street or at one of the
shops; most people had a favourite cover destination and Alleline’s was the
theatre. Mendel had never seen Alleline, but he had their description of him and
as he watched him through the glasses he recognised him without a doubt, a big
lumbering fellow in a dark coat; he even noticed how the cabby pulled a bad
face at his tip and called something after him as Alleline delved for his keys.

The front door is not secured, Guillam had explained; it is only locked. The
security begins inside, once you have turned left at the end of the corridor.
Alleline lives on the fifth floor. You won’t see his windows light up but there’s a
skylight and the glow should catch the chimney-stack. Sure enough, as he
watched, a patch of yellow appeared on the grimy bricks of the chimney:

Alleline had entered his room.

And young Guillam needs a holiday, thought Mendel. He’d seen that happen
before, too: the tough ones who crack at forty. They lock it away, pretend it isn’t
there, lean on grown-ups who turn out not to be so grown up after all; then one
day it’s all over them, and their heroes come tumbling down and they’re sitting
at their desks with the tears pouring onto the blotter.

He had laid the receiver on the floor. Picking it up, he said, “Looks like
Tinker’s clocked in.”

He gave the number of the cab, then went back to waiting.

“How did he look?” Smiley murmured.

“Busy,” said Mendel.

“So he should be.”

That one won’t crack, though, Mendel decided with approval; one of your
flabby oak trees, Smiley was. Think you could blow him over with one puff, but
when it comes to the storm he’s the only one left standing at the end of it. At this
point in his reflections a second cab drew up, squarely at the front entrance, and
a tall slow figure cautiously climbed the steps one at a time, like a man who
takes care of his heart.

“Here’s your Tailor,” Mendel murmured into the telephone. “Hold on, here’s
Soldier-boy, too. Proper gathering of the clans, by the look of it. I say, take it
easy.”

An old Mercedes 190 shot out of Earlham Street, swung directly beneath his
window, and held the curve with difficulty as far as the northern outlet of the
Charing Cross Road, where it parked. A young heavy fellow with ginger hair
clambered out, slammed the door, and clumped across the street to the entrance
without even taking the key out of the dash. A moment later another light went
up on the fourth floor as Roy Bland joined the party.

All we need to know now is who comes out, thought Mendel.

Lock Gardens, which presumably drew its name from the Camden and
Hampstead Road Locks nearby, was a terrace of four flat-fronted nineteenth-
century houses built at the centre of a crescent, each with three floors and a
basement and a strip of walled back garden running down to the Regent’s Canal.
The numbers ran 2 to 5: number 1 had either fallen down or never been built.
Number 5 made up the north end, and as a safe house it could not have been
improved, for there were three approaches in thirty yards and the canal towpath
offered two more. To the north lay Camden High Street for joining traffic; south
and west lay the parks and Primrose Hill. Better still, the neighbourhood
possessed no social identity and demanded none. Some of the houses had been
turned into one-room flats, and had ten doorbells laid out like a typewriter. Some
were got up grandly and had only one. Number 5 had two: one for M i ll ie
McCraig and one for her lodger, Mr. Jefferson.

Mrs. McCraig was churchy and collected for everything, which was
incidentally an excellent way of keeping an eye on the locals, though that was
scarcely how they viewed her zeal. Jefferson, her lodger, was known vaguely to
be foreign and in oil and away a lot. Lock Gardens was his pied-a-terre. The
neighbours, when they bothered to notice him, found him shy and respectable.
They would have formed the same impression of George Smiley if they had
happened to spot him in the dim light of the porch at nine that evening, as Millie
McCraig admitted him to her front room and drew the pious curtains. She was a
wiry Scottish widow with brown stockings and bobbed hair and the polished,
wrinkled skin of an old man. In the interest of God and the Circus, she had run
Bible schools in Mozambique and a seaman’s mission in Hamburg, and though
she had been a professional eavesdropper for twenty years since then, she was
still inclined to treat all menfolk as transgressors. Smiley had no way of telling
what she thought. Her manner, from the moment he arrived, had a deep and
lonely stillness; she showed him round the house like a chatelaine whose guests
had long since died.

First the semi-basement, where she lived herself, full of plants and that
medley of old postcards, brass table-tops, and carved black furniture which
seems to attach itself to travelled British ladies of a certain age and class. Yes, if
the Circus wanted her at night they rang her on the basement phone. Yes, there
was a separate line upstairs, but it was only for outgoing calls. The basement
phone had an extension in the upstairs dining-room. Then up to the ground floor.

a veritable shrine to the costly bad taste of the housekeepers: loud Regency
stripes, gilded reproduction chairs, plush sofas with roped corners. The kitchen
was untouched and squalid. Beyond it lay a glass outhouse, half conservatory,
half scullery, which looked down to the rough garden and the canal. Strewn over
the tiled floor: an old mangle, a copper tub, and crates of tonic water.

“Where are the mikes, Millie?” Smiley had returned to the drawing-room.

They were in pairs, Millie murmured, bedded behind the wallpaper: two pairs
to each room on the ground floor, one to each room upstairs. Each pair was
connected with a separate recorder. He followed her up the steep stairs. The top
floor was unfurnished save for an attic bedroom that contained a grey steel frame
with eight tape machines, four up, four down.

“And Jefferson knows all about this?”

“Mr. Jefferson,” said Millie primly, “is run on a basis of trust.” That was the
nearest she came to expressing her disapproval of Smiley, or her devotion to
Christian ethics.

Downstairs again, she showed him the switches that controlled the system. An
extra switch was fitted in each finger panel. Any time Jefferson or one of the
boys, as she put it, wanted to go over to record, he had only to get up and turn
down the left-hand light switch. From then on, the system was voice-activated;
that is to say, the tape deck did not turn unless somebody was speaking.

“And where are you while all this goes on, Millie?”

She remained downstairs, she said, as if that were a woman’s place.

Smiley was pulling open cupboards, lockers, walking from room to room.
Then back to the scullery again, with its view to the canal. Taking out a pocket
torch, he signalled one flash into the darkness of the garden.

“What are the safety procedures?” Smiley asked as he thoughtfully fingered
the end light switch by the drawing-room door.

Her reply came in a liturgical monotone. “Two full milk bottles on the
doorstep, you may come in and all’s well. No milk bottles and you’re not to
enter.”

From the direction of the sunroom came a faint tapping. Returning to the
scullery, Smiley opened the glazed door and after a hastily murmured
conversation reappeared with Guillam.

“You know Peter, don’t you, Millie?”

Millie might, she might not; her little hard eyes had fixed on him with scorn.
He was studying the switch panel, feeling in his pocket as he did so.

“What’s he doing? He’s not to do that. Stop him.”

If she was worried, said Smiley, she should ring Facon on the basement
phone. Millie McCraig didn’t stir, but two red bruises had appeared on her

leathery cheeks and she was snapping her fingers in anger. With a small
screwdriver Guillam had cautiously removed the screws from either side of the
plastic panel, and was peering at the wiring behind. Now, very carefully, he
turned the end switch upside down, twisting it on its wires, then screwed the
plate back in position, leaving the remaining switches undisturbed.

“We’ll just try it,” said Guillam, and while Smiley went upstairs to check the
tape deck, Guillam sang “Old Man River,” in a low Paul Robeson growl.

“Thank you,” said Smiley with a shudder, coming down again. “That’s more
than enough.”

Millie had gone to the basement to ring Lacon. Quietly, Smiley set the stage.
He put the telephone beside an armchair in the drawing-room, then cleared his
line of retreat to the scullery. He fetched two full bottles of milk from the icebox
and placed them on the doorstep to signify, in the eclectic language of Millie
McGraig, that you may come in and all’s well. He removed his shoes and took
them to the scullery, and having put out all the lights, took up his post in the
armchair just as Mendel made his connecting call.

On the canal towpath, meanwhile, Guillam had resumed his vigil of the house.
The footpath is closed to the public one hour before dark: after that it can be
anything from a trysting place for lovers to a haven for down-and-outs; both, for
different reasons, are attracted by the darkness of the bridges. That cold night
Guillam saw neither. Occasionally an empty train raced past, leaving a still
greater emptiness behind. His nerves were so taut, his expectations so varied,
that for a moment he saw the whole architecture of that night in apocalyptic
terms: the signals on the railway bridge turned to gallows; the Victorian
warehouses to gigantic prisons, their windows barred and arched against the
misty sky. Gloser at hand, the ripple of rats and the stink of still water. Then the
drawing-room lights went out; the house stood in darkness except for the chinks
of yellow to either side of Millie’s basement window. From the scullery a pin of
light winked at him down the unkempt garden. Taking a pen torch from his
pocket, he slipped out the silver hood, sighted it with shaking fingers at the point
from which the light had come, and signalled back. From now on, they could
only wait.

Tarr tossed the incoming telegram back to Ben, together with the one-time pad
from the safe.

“Gome on,” he said, “earn your pay. Unbutton it.”

“It’s personal for you,” Ben objected. “Look. 'Personal from Alleline
decypher yourself.’ I’m not allowed to touch it. It’s the tops.”

“Do as he asks, Ben,” said Mackelvore, watching Tarr.

For ten minutes, no word passed between the three men. Tarr was standing
across the room from them, very nervous from the waiting. He had jammed the
gun in his waistband. His jacket lay over a chair. The sweat had stuck his shirt to
his back all the way down. Ben was using a ruler to read off the number groups,
then carefully writing his findings on the block of graph paper before him. To
concentrate, he put his tongue against his teeth, and now he made a small click
as he withdrew it. Putting aside his pencil, he offered Tarr the tearsheet.

“Read it aloud,” Tarr said.

Ben’s voice was kindly, and a little fervent. “ 'Personal for Tarr from Alleline
decypher yourself. I positively require clarification and/or trade samples before
meeting your request. Quote information vital to safeguarding of the service
unquote does not qualify. Let me remind you of your bad position here following
your disgraceful disappearance stop urge you confide Mackelvore immediately
repeat immediately stop Chief.’ ”

Ben had not quite finished before Tarr began laughing in a strange, excited
way.

“That’s the way, Percy boy!” he cried. “Yes repeat no! Know why he’s
stalling, Ben, darling? He’s sizing up to shoot me in the bloody back! That’s how
he got my Russki girl. He’s playing the same tune, the bastard.” He was ruffling
Ben’s hair, shouting at him, laughing. “I warn you, Ben: there’s some damn
lousy people in this outfit, so don’t you trust the one of them. I’m telling you, or
you’ll never grow up strong!”

Alone in the darkness of the drawing-room, Smiley also waited, sitting in the
housekeeper’s uncomfortable chair, his head propped awkwardly against the
earpiece of the telephone. Occasionally he would mutter something and Mendel
would mutter back; most of the time they shared the silence. His mood was
subdued, even a little glum. Like an actor, he had a sense of approaching anti¬
climax before the curtain went up, a sense of great things dwindling to a small,
mean end; as death itself seemed small and mean to him after the struggles of his
life. He had no sense of conquest that he knew of. His thoughts, as often when
he was afraid, concerned people. He had no theories or judgements in particular.
He simply wondered how everyone would be affected; and he felt responsible.
He thought of Jim and Sam and Max and Connie and Jerry Westerby, and
personal loyalties all broken; in a separate category he thought of Ann and the
hopeless dislocation of their talk on the Cornish cliffs; he wondered whether
there was any love between human beings that did not rest upon some sort of
self-delusion; he wished he could just get up and walk out before it happened,
but he couldn’t. He worried, in a quite paternal way, about Guillam, and

wondered how he would take the late strains of growing up. He thought again of
the day he buried Control. He thought about treason and wondered whether there
was mindless treason in the same way, supposedly, as there was mindless
violence. It worried him that he felt so bankrupt; that whatever intellectual or
philosophical precepts he clung to broke down entirely now that he was faced
with the human situation.

“Anything?” he asked Mendel, into the telephone.

“A couple of drunks,” said Mendel, “singing 'See the jungle when it’s wet
with rain.’ ”

“Never heard of it.”

Changing the telephone to his left side, he drew the gun from the wallet
pocket of his jacket, where it had already ruined the excellent silk lining. He
discovered the safety catch, and for a moment played with the idea that he didn’t
know which way was on and which way off. He snapped out the magazine and
put it back, and remembered doing this hundreds of times on the trot, in the night
range at Sarratt before the war; he remembered how you always shot with two
hands, sir, one to hold the gun and one the magazine, sir; and how there was a
piece of Circus folklore which demanded that he should lay his index finger
along the barrel and pull the trigger with his second. But when he tried it the
sensation was ridiculous and he forgot about it.

“Just taking a walk,” he murmured, and Mendel said “Righty-ho.”

The gun still in his hand, he returned to the scullery, listening for a creak in
the floorboards that might give him away, but the floor must have been concrete
under the tatty carpet; he could have jumped and caused not even a vibration.
With his torch he signalled two short flashes, a long delay, then two more. At
once Guillam replied with three short.

“Back again.”

“Got you,” said Mendel.

He settled, thinking glumly of Ann: to dream the impossible dream. He put
the gun in his pocket. From the canal side, the moan of a hooter. At night? Boats
moving at night? Must be a car. What if Gerald has a whole emergency
procedure that we know nothing about? A call-box to call-box, a car pick-up?
What if Polyakov has after all a legman, a helper whom Connie never identified?
He’d been through that already. This system was built to be watertight, to
accommodate meetings in all contingencies. When it comes to tradecraft, Karla
is a pedant.

And his fancy that he was being followed? What of that? What of the shadow
he never saw, only felt, till his back seemed to tingle with the intensity of his
watcher’s gaze; he saw nothing, heard nothing, only felt. He was too old not to

heed the warning. The creak of a stair that had not creaked before; the rustle of a
shutter when no wind was blowing; the car with a different number plate but the
same scratch on the offside wing; the face on the Metro that you know you have
seen somewhere before: for years at a time these were signs he had lived by; any
one of them was reason enough to move, change towns, identities. For in that
profession there is no such thing as coincidence.

“One gone,” said Mendel suddenly. “Hullo?”

“Tm here.”

Somebody had just come out of the Circus, said Mendel. Front door, but he
couldn’t be certain of the identification. Mackintosh and hat. Bulky and moving
fast. He must have ordered a cab to the door and stepped straight into it.

“Heading north, your way.”

Smiley looked at his watch. Give him ten minutes, he thought. Give him
twelve; he’ll have to stop and phone Polyakov on the way. Then he thought.
Don’t be silly, he’s done that already from the Circus.

“I’m ringing off,” said Smiley.

“Cheers,” said Mendel.

On the footpath, Guillam read three long flashes. The mole is on his way.

In the scullery Smiley had once more checked his thoroughfare, shoved some
deck-chairs aside, and pinned a string to the mangle to guide him because he saw
badly in the dark. The string led to the open kitchen door, and the kitchen led to
the drawing-room and dining-room both; it had the two doors side by side. The
kitchen was a long room, actually an annexe to the house before the glass
scullery was added. He had thought of using the dining-room but it was too
risky, and besides from the dining-room he couldn’t signal to Guillam. So he
waited in the scullery, feeling absurd in his stockinged feet, polishing his
spectacles because the heat of his face kept misting them. It was much colder in
the scullery. The drawing-room was close and overheated but the scullery had
these outside walls, and this glass and this concrete floor beneath the matting,
which made his feet feel wet. The mole arrives first, he thought; the mole plays
host: that is protocol, part of the pretence that Polyakov is Gerald’s agent.

A London taxi is a flying bomb.

The comparison rose in him slowly, from deep in his unconscious memory.
The clatter as it barges into the crescent, the metric tick-tick as the bass notes die.
The cut-off: where has it stopped, which house—when all of us on the street are
waiting in the dark, crouching under tables or clutching at pieces of string—
which house? Then the slam of the door, the explosive anti-climax: if you can
hear it, it’s not for you.

But Smiley heard it, and it was for him.

He heard the tread of one pair of feet on the gravel, brisk and vigorous. They
stopped. It’s the wrong door, Smiley thought absurdly; go away. He had the gun
in his hand; he had dropped the catch. Still he listened, heard nothing. You’re
suspicious, Gerald, he thought. You’re an old mole, you can sniff there’s
something wrong. Millie, he thought; Millie has taken away the milk bottles, put
up a warning, headed him off. Millie’s spoilt the kill. Then he heard the latch
turn, one turn, two; it’s a Banham lock, he remembered—my God, we must keep
Banham’s in business. Of course: the mole had been patting his pockets, looking
for his key. A nervous man would have it in his hand already, would have been
clutching it, cosseting it in his pocket all the way in the taxi; but not the mole.
The mole might be worried but he was not nervous. At the same moment the
latch turned, the bell chimed—housekeepers’ taste again: high tone, low tone,
high tone. That will mean it’s one of us, Millie had said; one of the boys, her
boys, Gonnie’s boys, Karla’s boys. The front door opened, someone stepped into
the house, he heard the shuffle of the mat, he heard the door close, he heard the
light switches snap and saw a pale line appear under the kitchen door. He put the
gun in his pocket and wiped the palm of his hand on his jacket, then took it out
again and in the same moment he heard a second flying bomb, a second taxi
pulling up, and footsteps fast. Polyakov didn’t just have the key ready, he had his
taxi money ready, too: do Russians tip, he wondered, or is tipping undemocratic?
Again the bell rang, the front door opened and closed, and Smiley heard the
double chink as two milk bottles were put on the hall table in the interest of good
order and sound tradecraft.

Lord save me, thought Smiley in horror as he stared at the old icebox beside
him; it never crossed my mind: suppose he had wanted to put them back in the
fridge?

The strip of light under the kitchen door grew suddenly brighter as the
drawing-room lights were switched on. An extraordinary silence descended over
the house. Holding the string, Smiley edged forward over the icy floor. Then he
heard voices. At first they were indistinct. They must still be at the far end of the
room, he thought. Or perhaps they always begin in a low tone. Now Polyakov
came nearer: he was at the trolley, pouring drinks.

“What is our cover story in case we are disturbed?” he asked in good English.

“Lovely voice,” Smiley remembered; “mellow like yours. I often used to play
the tapes twice, just to listen to him speaking.” Gonnie, you should hear him
now.

From the further end of the room still, a muffled murmur answered each
question. Smiley could make nothing of it. “Where shall we regroup?” “What is

our fallback?” “Have you anything on you that you would prefer me to be
carrying during our talk, bearing in mind I have diplomatic immunity?”

It must be a catechism, Smiley thought; part of Karla’s school routine.

“Is the switch down? Will you please check? Thank you. What will you
drink?”

“Scotch,” said Haydon, “a bloody great big one.”

With a feeling of utter disbelief, Smiley listened to the familiar voice reading
aloud the very telegram that Smiley himself had drafted for Tarr’s use only forty-
eight hours ago.

Then, for a moment, one part of Smiley broke into open revolt against the
other. The wave of angry doubt that had swept over him in Lacon’s garden, and
that ever since had pulled against his progress like a worrying tide, drove him
now on to the rocks of despair, and then to mutiny: I refuse. Nothing is worth the
destruction of another human being. Somewhere the path of pain and betrayal
must end. Until that happened, there was no future; there was only a continued
slide into still more terrifying versions of the present. This man was my friend
and Ann’s lover, Jim’s friend and—for all I know—Jim’s lover, too; it was the
treason, not the man, that belonged to the public domain.

Haydon had betrayed. As a lover, a colleague, a friend; as a patriot; as a
member of that inestimable body that Ann loosely called the Set: in every
capacity, Haydon had overtly pursued one aim and secretly achieved its opposite.
Smiley knew very well that even now he did not grasp the scope of that
appalling duplicity; yet there was a part of him that rose already in Haydon’s
defence. Was not Bill also betrayed? Connie’s lament rang in his ears: “Poor
loves. Trained to Empire, trained to rule the waves ... You’re the last, George,
you and Bill.” He saw with painful clarity an ambitious man born to the big
canvas, brought up to rule, divide and conquer, whose visions and vanities all
were fixed, like Percy’s, upon the world’s game; for whom the reality was a poor
island with scarcely a voice that would carry across the water. Thus Smiley felt
not only disgust, but, despite all that the moment meant to him, a surge of
resentment against the institutions he was supposed to be protecting: “The social
contract cuts both ways, you know,” said Lacon. The Minister’s lolling
mendacity, Lacon’s tight-lipped moral complacency, the bludgeoning greed of
Percy Alleline: such men invalidated any contract—why should anyone be loyal
to them?

He knew, of course. He had always known it was Bill. Just as Control had
known, and Lacon in Mendel’s house. Just as Connie and Jim had known, and
Alleline and Esterhase; all of them had tacitly shared that unexpressed half¬
knowledge which was like an illness they hoped would go away if it was never

owned to, never diagnosed.

And Ann? Did Ann know? Was that the shadow that fell over them that day
on the Cornish cliffs?

For a space, that was how Smiley stood: a fat, barefooted spy, as Ann would
say, deceived in love and impotent in hate, clutching a gun in one hand, a bit of
string in the other, as he waited in the darkness. Then, gun still in hand, he
tiptoed backward as far as the window, from which he signalled five short
flashes in quick succession. Having waited long enough to read the
acknowledgement, he returned to his listening post.

Guillam raced down the canal towpath, the torch jolting wildly in his hand, till
he reached a low arched bridge and a steel stairway that led upward in zigzags to
Gloucester Avenue. The gate was closed and he had to climb it, ripping one
sleeve to the elbow. Lacon was standing at the corner of Princess Road, wearing
an old country coat and carrying a briefcase.

“He’s there. He’s arrived,” Guillam whispered. “He’s got Gerald.” “I won’t
have bloodshed,” Lacon warned. “I want absolute calm.”

Guillam didn’t bother to reply. Thirty yards down the road Mendel was
waiting in a tame cab. They drove for two minutes, not so much, and stopped the
cab short of the crescent. Guillam was holding Esterhase’s door key. Reaching
number 5, Mendel and Guillam stepped over the gate, rather than risk the noise
of it, and kept to the grass verge. As they went, Guillam glanced back and
thought for a moment he saw a figure watching them—man or woman, he
couldn’t tell—from the shadow of a doorway across the road; but when he drew
Mendel’s attention to the spot there was nothing there, and Mendel ordered him
quite roughly to calm down. The porch light was out. Guillam went ahead;
Mendel waited under an apple tree. Guillam inserted the key, felt the lock ease as
he turned it. Damn fool, he thought triumphantly, why didn’t you drop the latch?
He pushed open the door an inch and hesitated. He was breathing slowly, filling
his lungs for action. Mendel moved forward another bound. In the street two
young boys went by, laughing loudly because they were nervous of the night.
Once more Guillam looked back but the crescent was clear. He stepped into the
hall. He was wearing suede shoes and they squeaked on the parquet; there was
no carpet. At the drawing-room door he listened long enough for the fury to
break in him at last.

His butchered agents in Morocco, his exile to Brixton, the daily frustration of
his efforts as daily he grew older and youth slipped through his fingers; the
drabness that was closing round him; the truncation of his power to love, enjoy,
and laugh; the constant erosion of the standards he wished to live by; the checks

and stops he had imposed on himself in the name of tacit dedication—he could
fling them all in Haydon’s sneering face. Haydon, once his confessor; Haydon,
always good for a laugh, a chat, and a cup of burnt coffee; Haydon, a model on
which he built his life.

And more. Now that he saw, he knew. Haydon was more than his model, he
was his inspiration, the torch-bearer of a certain kind of antiquated romanticism,
a notion of English calling which—for the very reason that it was vague and
understated and elusive—had made sense of Guillam’s life till now. In that
moment, Guillam felt not merely betrayed but orphaned. His suspicions, his
resentments for so long turned outward on the real world—on his women, his
attempted loves—now swung upon the Gircus and the failed magic that had
formed his faith. With all his force he shoved open the door and sprang inside,
gun in hand. Haydon and a heavy man with black hair were seated either side of
a small table. Polyakov—Guillam recognised him from the photographs—was
smoking a very English pipe. He wore a grey cardigan with a zip down the front,
like the top half of a track suit. He had not even taken the pipe from his mouth
before Guillam had Haydon by the collar. With a single heave he lifted him
straight out of his chair. He had thrown away his gun and was hurling Haydon
from side to side, shaking him, and shouting. Then suddenly there seemed no
point. After all, it was only Bill and they had done a lot together. Guillam had
drawn back long before Mendel took his arm, and he heard Smiley, politely as
ever, inviting “Bill and Golonel Viktorov,” as he called them, to raise their hands
and place them on their heads till Percy Alleline arrived.

“There was no one out there, was there, that you noticed?” Smiley asked of
Guillam, while they waited.

“Quiet as the grave,” said Mendel, answering for both of them.

37

There are moments that are made up of too much stuff for them to be lived at the
time they occur. For Guillam and all those present, this was one. Smiley’s
continued distraction and Haydon’s indifference; his frequent cautious glances
from the window; Polyakov’s predictable fit of indignation, his demands to be
treated as became a member of the Diplomatic Corps—demands that Guillam
from his place on the sofa tersely threatened to meet; the flustered arrival of
Alleline and Bland; more protestations and the pilgrimage upstairs, where
Smiley played the tapes; the long glum silence that followed their return to the
drawing-room; the arrival of Lacon and finally of Esterhase and Fawn; Millie
McCraig’s silent ministrations with the teapot: all these events and cameos
unrolled with a theatrical unreality that, much like the trip to Ascot an age
before, was intensified by the unreality of the hour of day. It was also true that
these incidents, which included at an early point the physical constraint of
Polyakov—and a stream of Russian abuse directed at Fawn for hitting him,
heaven knows where, despite Mendel’s vigilance—were like a silly subplot
against Smiley’s only purpose in convening the assembly: to persuade Alleline
that Haydon offered Smiley’s one chance to treat with Karla, and to save, in
humanitarian if not professional terms, whatever was left of the networks that
Haydon had betrayed. Smiley was not empowered to conduct these transactions,
nor did he seem to want to; perhaps he reckoned that between them Esterhase
and Bland and Alleline were better placed to know what agents were still
theoretically in being. In any event he soon took himself upstairs, where Guillam
heard him once more restlessly padding from one room to the other as he
continued his vigil from the windows.

So while Alleline and his lieutenants withdrew with Polyakov to the dining¬
room to conduct their business alone, the rest of them sat in silence in the
drawing-room, either looking at Haydon or deliberately away from him. He
seemed unaware that they were there. Ghin in hand, he sat apart from them in a
corner, watched over by Fawn, and he looked rather bored. The conference
ended, they all trooped out of the dining-room and Alleline announced to Lacon,
who insisted on not being present at the discussions, that an appointment had
been made three days hence at this address, by which time “the Golonel will
have had a chance to consult his superiors.” Lacon nodded. It might have been a
board meeting.

The departures were even stranger than the arrivals. Between Esterhase and

Polyakov in particular, there was a curiously poignant farewell. Esterhase, who
would always rather have been a gentleman than a spy, seemed determined to
make a gallant occasion of it, and offered his hand, which Polyakov struck
petulantly aside. Esterhase looked round forlornly for Smiley, perhaps in the
hope of ingratiating himself further with him, then shrugged and flung an arm
across Bland’s broad shoulder. Soon afterwards they left together. They didn’t
say goodbye to anybody, but Bland looked dreadfully shaken and Esterhase
seemed to be consoling him, though his own future at that moment could hardly
have struck him as rosy. Soon afterwards a radio cab arrived for Polyakov and
he, too, left without a nod to anyone. By now, the conversation had died entirely;
without the Russian present, the show became wretchedly parochial. Haydon
remained in his familiar bored pose, still watched by Fawn and Mendel, and
stared at in mute embarrassment by Lacon and Alleline. More telephone calls
were made, mainly for cars. At some point Smiley reappeared from upstairs and
mentioned Tarr. Alleline phoned the Circus and dictated one telegram to Paris
saying that he could return to England with honour, whatever that meant; and a
second to Mackelvore saying that Tarr was an acceptable person, which again
seemed to Guillam a matter of opinion.

Finally, to the general relief, a windowless van arrived from the Nursery, and
two men got out whom Guillam had never seen before, one tall and limping, the
other doughy and fair-haired. With a shudder Guillam realised they were
inquisitors. Fawn fetched Haydon’s coat from the hall, went through the pockets,
and respectfully helped him into it. At this point, Smiley gently interposed
himself and insisted that Haydon’s walk from the front door to the van should
take place without the hall light on, and that the escort should be large. Guillam,
Fawn, even Alleline, were pressed into service, and finally, with Haydon at its
centre, the whole motley group shuffled through the garden to the van.

“It’s simply a precaution,” Smiley insisted. No one was disposed to argue with
him. Haydon climbed in, and the inquisitors followed, locking the grille from
inside. As the doors closed, Haydon lifted one hand in an amiable, if dismissive,
gesture directed at Alleline.

So it was only afterwards that separate things came back to Guillam and
single people came forward for his recollection: the unqualified hatred, for
instance, which Polyakov directed against everyone present, from poor little
Millie McGraig upwards, and which actually distorted him; his mouth curved in
a savage, uncontrollable sneer, he turned white and trembled, but not from fear
and not from anger. It was just plain hatred, of the sort that Guillam could not
visit on Haydon, but then Haydon was of his own kind.

For Alleline, in the moment of his defeat, Guillam discovered a sneaking

admiration: Alleline at least had shown a certain bearing. But later Guillam was
not so sure whether Percy realised, on that first presentation of the facts, quite
what the facts were: after all, he was still Chief, and Haydon was still his lago.

But the strangest thing to Guillam, the insight that he took away with him and
thought over much more deeply than was commonly his policy, was that despite
his banked-up anger at the moment of breaking into the room, it required an act
of will on his own part—and quite a violent one, at that—to regard Bill Haydon
with much other than affection. Perhaps, as Bill would say, he had finally grown
up. Best of all, on the same evening he climbed the steps to his flat and heard the
familiar notes of Camilla’s flute echoing in the well. And if Camilla that night
lost something of her mystery, at least by morning he had succeeded in freeing
her from the toils of double-cross to which he had latterly consigned her.

In other ways also, over the next few days, his life took on a brighter look.
Percy Alleline had been dispatched on indefinite leave; Smiley had been asked
to come back for a while and help sweep up what was left. For Guillam himself
there was talk of being rescued from Brixton. It was not till much, much later
that he learned that there had been a final act; and he put a name and a purpose
to that familiar shadow which had followed Smiley through the night streets of
Kensington.

38

For the next two days George Smiley lived in limbo. To his neighbours, when
they noticed him, he seemed to have lapsed into a wasting grief. He rose late and
pottered round the house in his dressing gown, cleaning things, dusting, cooking
himself meals and not eating them. In the afternoon, quite against the local by¬
laws, he lit a coal fire and sat before it reading among his German poets or
writing letters to Ann, which he seldom completed and never posted. When the
telephone rang, he went to it quickly, only to be disappointed. Outside the
window the weather continued foul, and the few passers-by—Smiley studied
them continuously—were huddled in Balkan misery. Once Lacon called with a
request from the Minister that Smiley should “stand by to help clear up the mess
at Gambridge Gircus, were he called upon to do so”—in effect, to act as night
watchman till a replacement for Percy Alleline could be found. Replying
vaguely, Smiley prevailed on Lacon to take extreme care of Haydon’s physical
safety while he was at Sarratt.

“Aren’t you being a little dramatic?” Lacon retorted. “The only place he can
go is Russia, and we’re sending him there any way.”

“When? How soon?”

The details would take several more days to arrange. Smiley disdained, in his
state of anti-climactic reaction, to ask how the interrogation was progressing
meanwhile, but Lacon’s manner suggested that the answer would have been
“badly.” Mendel brought him more solid fare.

“Immingham railway station’s shut,” he said. “You’ll have to get out at
Grimsby and hoof it or take a bus.”

More often, Mendel simply sat and watched him, as one might an invalid.
“Waiting won’t make her come, you know,” he said once. “Time the mountain
went to Mohammed. Faint heart never won fair lady, if I may say so.”

On the morning of the third day, the doorbell rang and Smiley answered it so
fast that it might have been Ann, having mislaid her key as usual. It was Lacon.
Smiley was required at Sarratt, he said; Haydon insisted on seeing him. The
inquisitors had got nowhere and time was running out. The understanding was
that if Smiley would act as confessor, Haydon would give a limited account of
himself.

“I’m assured there has been no coercion,” Lacon said.

Sarratt was a sorry place after the grandeur that Smiley remembered. Most of
the elms had gone with the disease; pylons burgeoned over the old cricket field.

The house itself, a sprawling brick mansion, had also come down a lot since the
heyday of the cold war in Europe, and most of the better furniture seemed to
have disappeared, he supposed into one of Alleline’s houses. He found Haydon
in a Nissen hut hidden among the trees.

Inside, it had the stink of an army guardhouse, black-painted walls and high-
barred windows. Guards manned the rooms to either side and they received
Smiley respectfully, calling him “sir.” The word, it seemed, had got around.
Haydon was dressed in denims, he was trembling, and he complained of
dizziness. Several times he had to lie on his bed to stop the nosebleeds he was
having. He had grown a half-hearted beard: apparently there was a dispute about
whether he was allowed a razor.

“Cheer up,” said Smiley. “You’ll be out of here soon.”

He had tried, on the journey down, to remember Prideaux, and Irina, and the
Czech networks, and he even entered Haydon’s room with a vague notion of
public duty: somehow, he thought, he ought to censure him on behalf of right-
thinking men. He felt instead rather shy; he felt he had never known Haydon at
all, and now it was too late. He was also angry at Haydon’s physical condition,
but when he taxed the guards they professed mystification. He was angrier still
to learn that the additional security precautions he had insisted on had been
relaxed after the first day. When he demanded to see Craddox, head of Nursery,
Craddox was unavailable and his assistant acted dumb.

Their first conversation was halting and banal.

Would Smiley please forward the mail from his club, and tell Alleline to get a
move on with the horse-trading with Karla? And he needed tissues, paper tissues
for his nose. His habit of weeping, Haydon explained, had nothing to do with
remorse or pain; it was a physical reaction to what he called the pettiness of the
inquisitors, who had made up their minds that Haydon knew the names of other
Karla recruits, and were determined to have them before he left. There was also
a school of thought which held that Fanshawe, of the Christ Church Optimates,
had been acting as a talent-spotter for Moscow Centre as well as for the Circus,
Haydon explained. “Really, what can one do with asses like that?” He managed,
despite his weakness, to convey that his was the only level head around. They
walked in the grounds, and Smiley established with something close to despair
that the perimeter was not even patrolled any more, either by night or by day.
After one circuit, Haydon asked to go back to the hut, where he dug up a piece
of floorboard and extracted some sheets of paper covered in hieroglyphics. They
reminded Smiley forcibly of Irina’s diary. Squatting on the bed, he sorted
through them, and in that pose, in that dull light, with his long forelock dangling
almost to the paper, he might have been lounging in Control’s room, back in the

sixties, propounding some wonderfully plausible and quite inoperable piece of
skulduggery for England’s greater glory. Smiley did not bother to write anything
down, since it was common ground between them that their conversation was
being recorded anyway. The statement began with a long apologia, of which he
afterwards recalled only a few sentences.

“We live in an age where only fundamental issues matter ...

“The United States is no longer capable of undertaking its own revolution ...

“The political posture of the United Kingdom is without relevance or moral
viability in world affairs ...”

With much of it, Smiley might, in other circumstances, have agreed; it was the
tone, rather than the music, that alienated him.

“In capitalist America economic repression of the masses is institutionalised
to a point which not even Lenin could have foreseen ...

“The cold war began in 1917 but the bitterest struggles lie ahead of us, as
America’s death-bed paranoia drives her to greater excesses abroad ...”

He spoke not of the decline of the West, but of its death by greed and
constipation. He hated America very deeply, he said, and Smiley supposed he
did. Haydon also took it for granted that secret services were the only real
measure of a nation’s political health, the only real expression of its
subconscious.

Finally he came to his own case. At Oxford, he said, he was genuinely of the
right, and in the war it scarcely mattered where one stood as long as one was
fighting the Germans. For a while, after ’45, he said, he had remained content
with Britain’s part in the world, till gradually it dawned on him just how trivial
this was. How and when was a mystery. In the historical mayhem of his own
lifetime he could point to no one occasion; simply he knew that if England were
out of the game, the price of fish would not be altered by a farthing. He had
often wondered which side he would be on if the test ever came; after prolonged
reflection he had finally to admit that if either monolith had to win the day, he
would prefer it to be the East.

“It’s an aesthetic judgement as much as anything,” he explained, looking up.
“Partly a moral one, of course.”

“Of course,” said Smiley politely.

From then on, he said, it was only a matter of time before he put his efforts
where his convictions lay.

That was the first day’s take. A white sediment had formed on Haydon’s lips,
and he had begun weeping again. They agreed to meet tomorrow at the same
time.

“It would be nice to go into the detail a little, if we could. Bill,” Smiley said as

he left.

“Oh, and look—tell Jan, will you?” Haydon was lying on the bed, staunching
his nose again. “Doesn’t matter a hoot what you say, long as you make it final.”
Sitting up, he wrote out a cheque and put it in a brown envelope. “Give her that
for the milk bill.”

Realising, perhaps, that Smiley was not quite at ease with this brief, he added,
“Well, I can’t take her with me, can I? Even if they let her come, she’d be a
bloody millstone.”

The same evening, following Haydon’s instructions, Smiley took a tube to
Kentish Town and unearthed a cottage in an unconverted mews. A flat-faced fair
girl in jeans opened the door to him; there was a smell of oil paint and baby. He
could not remember whether he had met her at By water Street, so he opened
with “I’m from Bill Haydon. He’s quite all right but I’ve got various messages
from him.”

“Jesus,” said the girl softly. “About bloody time and all.”

The drawing-room was filthy. Through the kitchen door he saw a pile of dirty
crockery and he knew she used everything until it ran out, then washed it all at
once. The floorboards were bare except for long psychedelic patterns of snakes
and flowers and insects painted over them.

“That’s Bill’s Michelangelo ceiling,” she said conversationally. “Only he’s not
going to have Michelangelo’s bad back. Are you government?” she asked,
lighting a cigarette. “He works for government, he told me.” Her hand was
shaking and she had yellow smudges under her eyes.

“Oh, look, first I’m to give you that,” said Smiley, reaching in an inside
pocket, and handing her the envelope with the cheque.

“Bread,” said the girl, and put the envelope beside her.

“Bread,” said Smiley, answering her grin; then something in his expression, or
the way he echoed that one word, made her take up the envelope and rip it open.
There was no note, just the cheque, but the cheque was enough; even from where
Smiley sat, he could see it had four figures.

Not knowing what she was doing, she walked across the room to the fireplace
and put the cheque with the grocery bills in an old tin on the mantelpiece. She
went into the kitchen and mixed two cups of Nescafe, but she came out with
only one.

“Where is he?” she said. She stood facing him. “He’s gone chasing after that
snotty little sailor-boy again. Is that it? And this is the pay-off, is that it? Well,
you bloody tell him from me—”

Smiley had had scenes like this before, and now absurdly the old words came
back to him.

“Bill’s been doing work of national importance. I’m afraid we can’t talk about
it, and nor must you. A few days ago he went abroad on a secret job. He’ll be
away some while. Even years. He wasn’t allowed to tell anyone he was leaving.
He wants you to forget him. I really am most awfully sorry.”

He got that far before she burst out. He didn’t hear all she said, because she
was blurting and screaming, and when the baby heard her it started screaming,
too, from upstairs. She was swearing—not at him, not even particularly at Bill,
just swearing dry-eyed—and demanding to know who the hell, who the bloody
bloody hell believed in government any more? Then her mood changed. Round
the walls, Smiley noticed Bill’s other paintings, mainly of the girl; few were
finished, and they had a cramped, condemned quality by comparison with his
earlier work.

“You don’t like him, do you? I can tell,” she said. “So why do you do his dirty
work for him?”

To this question also there seemed no immediate answer. Returning to
Bywater Street, he again had the impression of being followed, and tried to
telephone Mendel with the number of a cab which had twice caught his eye, and
to ask him to make immediate enquiries. For once, Mendel was out till after
midnight: Smiley slept uneasily and woke at five. By eight he was back at
Sarratt, to find Haydon in a festive mood. The inquisitors had not bothered him;
he had been told by Craddox that the exchanges had been agreed and he should
expect to travel tomorrow or the next day. His requests had a valedictory ring:
the balance of his salary and the proceeds of any odd sales made on his behalf
should be forwarded to him care of the Moscow Narodny Bank, which would
also handle his mail. The Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol had a few pictures of his,
including some early water-colours of Damascus, which he coveted. Could
Smiley please arrange? Then, the cover for his disappearance:

“Play it long,” he advised. “Say I’ve been posted, lay on the mystery, give it a
couple of years, then run me down ...”

“Oh, I think we can manage something, thank you,” Smiley said.

For the first time since Smiley had known him, Haydon was worried about
clothes. He wanted to arrive looking like someone, he said; first impressions
were so important. “Those Moscow tailors are unspeakable. Dress you up like a
bloody beadle.”

“Quite,” said Smiley, whose opinion of Fondon tailors was no better.

Oh, and there was a boy, he added carelessly, a sailor friend, lived in Netting
Hill. “Better give him a couple of hundred to shut him up. Can you do that out of
the reptile fund?”

“I’m sure.”

He wrote out an address. In the same spirit of good fellowship, Haydon then
entered into what Smiley had called the details.

He declined to discuss any part of his recruitment or of his lifelong
relationship with Karla. “Lifelong?” Smiley repeated quickly. “When did you
meet?” The assertions of yesterday appeared suddenly nonsensical; but Haydon
would not elaborate.

From about 1950 onwards, if he was to be believed, Haydon had made Karla
occasional selected gifts of intelligence. These early efforts were confined to
what he hoped would directly advance the Russian cause over the American; he
was “scrupulous not to give them anything harmful to ourselves,” as he put it, or
harmful to our agents in the field.

The Suez adventure in ’56 finally persuaded him of the inanity of the British
situation, and of the British capacity to spike the advance of history while not
being able to offer anything by way of contribution. The sight of the Americans
sabotaging the British action in Egypt was, paradoxically, an additional
incentive. He would say therefore that from ’56 on, he was a committed, full¬
time Soviet mole with no holds barred. In 1961 he formally received Soviet
citizenship, and over the next ten years two Soviet medals—quaintly, he would
not say which, though he insisted that they were “top stuff.” Unfortunately,
overseas postings during this period limited his access; and since he insisted on
his information being acted upon wherever possible—“rather than being
chucked into some daft Soviet archive”—his work was dangerous as well as
uneven. With his return to London, Karla sent him Polly (which seemed to be the
house name for Polyakov) as a helpmate, but Haydon found the constant
pressure of clandestine meetings difficult to sustain, particularly in view of the
quantity of stuff he was photographing.

He declined to discuss cameras, equipment, pay, or tradecraft during this pre-
Merlin period in London, and Smiley was conscious all the while that even the
little Haydon was telling him was selected with meticulous care from a greater,
and perhaps somewhat different truth.

Meanwhile both Karla and Haydon were receiving signals that Control was
smelling a rat. Control was ill, of course, but clearly he would never willingly
give up the reins while there was a chance that he was making Karla a present of
the service. It was a race between Control’s researches and his health. Twice he
had very nearly struck gold—again Haydon declined to say how—and if Karla
had not been quick on his feet, the mole Gerald would have been trapped. It was
out of this nervy situation that first Merlin and finally Operation Testify were
born. Witchcraft was conceived primarily to take care of the succession: to put
Alleline next to the throne, and hasten Control’s demise. Secondly, of course.

Witchcraft gave Centre absolute autonomy over the product flowing into
Whitehall. Thirdly—and in the long run most important, Haydon insisted—it
brought the Circus into position as a major weapon against the American target.

“How much of the material was genuine?” Smiley asked.

Obviously the standard varied according to what one wanted to achieve, said
Haydon. In theory, fabrication was very easy: Haydon had only to advise Karla
of Whitehall’s areas of ignorance and the fabricators would write for them. Once
or twice, for the hell of it, said Haydon, he had written the odd report himself. It
was an amusing exercise to receive, evaluate, and distribute one’s own work.

The advantages of Witchcraft in terms of tradecraft were, of course, inestimable.
It placed Haydon virtually out of Control’s reach, and gave him a cast-iron cover
story for meeting Polly whenever he wished. Often months would pass without
their meeting at all. Haydon would photograph Circus documents in the
seclusion of his room—under cover of preparing Polly’s chicken-feed—hand it
over to Esterhase with a lot of other rubbish, and let him cart it down to the safe
house in Lock Gardens.

“It was a classic,” Haydon said simply. “Percy made the running, 1
slipstreamed behind him, Roy and Toby did the legwork.”

Here Smiley asked politely whether Karla had ever thought of having Haydon
actually take over the Circus himself: why bother with a stalking-horse at all?
Haydon stalled and it occurred to Smiley that Karla, like Control, might well
have considered Haydon better cast as a subordinate.

Operation Testify, said Haydon, was rather a desperate throw. Haydon was
certain that Control was getting very warm indeed. An analysis of the files he
was drawing produced an uncomfortably complete inventory of the operations
that Haydon had blown, or otherwise caused to abort. He had also succeeded in
narrowing the field to officers of a certain age and rank ...

“Was Stevcek’s original offer genuine, by the way?” Smiley asked.

“Good Lord, no,” said Haydon, actually shocked. “It was a fix from the start.
Stevcek existed, of course. He was a distinguished Czech general. But he never
made an offer to anyone.”

Here Smiley sensed Haydon falter. Lor the first time, he actually seemed
uneasy about the morality of his behaviour. His manner became noticeably
defensive.

“Obviously, we needed to be certain Control would rise, and how he would
rise ... and who he would send. We couldn’t have him picking some half-arsed
little pavement artist; it had to be a big gun to make the story stick. We knew
he’d only settle for someone outside the mainstream and someone who wasn’t
Witchcraft-cleared. If we made it a Czech, he’d have to choose a Czech speaker.

naturally.”

“Naturally.”

“We wanted old Circus: someone who could bring down the temple a bit.”

“Yes,” said Smiley, remembering that heaving, sweating figure on the hilltop.
“Yes, I see the logic of that.”

“Well, damn it, I got him back,” Haydon snapped.

“Yes, that was good of you. Tell me, did Jim come to see you before he left on
that Testify mission?”

“Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.”

“To say what?”

For a long, long while Haydon hesitated, then did not answer. But the answer
was written there, all the same: in the sudden emptying of his eyes, in the
shadow of guilt that crossed his face. He came to warn you, Smiley thought;
because he loved you. To warn you; just as he came to tell me that Control was
mad, but couldn’t find me because I was in Berlin. Jim was watching your back
for you right till the end.

Also, Haydon resumed, it had to be a country with a recent history of counter¬
revolution: Czecho was honestly the only place.

Smiley appeared not quite to be listening.

“Why did you bring him back?” he asked. “For friendship’s sake? Because he
was harmless and you held all the cards?”

It wasn’t just that, Haydon explained. As long as Jim was in a Czech prison
(he didn’t say Russian), people would agitate for him and see him as some sort
of key. But once he was back, everyone in Whitehall would conspire to keep him
quiet; that was the way of it with repatriations.

“I’m surprised Karla didn’t just shoot him. Or did he hold back out of delicacy
towards you?”

But Haydon had drifted away again into half-baked political assertions.

Then he began speaking about himself, and already, to Smiley’s eye, he
seemed visibly to be shrinking to something quite small and mean. He was
touched to hear that Ionesco had recently promised us a play in which the hero
kept silent and everyone round him spoke incessantly. When the psychologists
and fashionable historians came to write their apologias for him, he hoped they
would remember that that was how he saw himself. As an artist he had said all
he had to say at the age of seventeen, and one had to do something with one’s
later years. He was awfully sorry he couldn’t take some of his friends with him.
He hoped Smiley would remember him with affection.

Smiley wanted at that point to tell him that he would not remember him in
those terms at all, and a good deal more besides, but there seemed no point and

Haydon was having another nosebleed.

“Oh, I’m to ask you to avoid publicity, by the way. Miles Sercombe made
quite a thing of it.”

Here Haydon managed a laugh. Having messed up the Circus in private, he
said, he had no wish to repeat the process in public.

Before he left, Smiley asked the one question he still cared about.

“I’ll have to break it to Ann. Is there anything particular you want me to pass
on to her?”

It required discussion for the implication of Smiley’s question to get through
to him. At first, he thought Smiley had said “Jan,” and couldn’t understand why
he had not yet called on her.

“Oh, your Ann,” he said, as if there were a lot of Ann’s around.

It was Karla’s idea, he explained. Karla had long recognised that Smiley
represented the biggest threat to the mole Gerald. “He said you were quite
good.”

“Thank you.”

“But you had this one price: Ann. The last illusion of the illusionless man. He
reckoned that if I were known to be Ann’s lover around the place you wouldn’t
see me very straight when it came to other things.” His eyes, Smiley noticed, had
become very fixed. Pewtery, Ann called them. “Not to strain it or anything but, if
it was possible, join the queue. Point?”

“Point,” said Smiley.

For instance, on the night of Testify, Karla was adamant that if possible
Haydon should be dallying with Ann. As a form of insurance.

“And wasn’t there in fact a small hitch that night?” Smiley asked,
remembering Sam Collins and the matter of whether Ellis had been shot.

Haydon agreed that there had been. If everything had gone according to plan, the
first Czech bulletins should have broken at ten-thirty. Haydon would have had a
chance to read his club ticker-tape after Sam Collins had rung Ann, and before
he arrived at the Circus to take over. But because Jim had been shot, there was
fumble at the Czech end and the bulletin was released after his club had closed.

“Lucky no one followed it up,” he said, helping himself to another of Smiley’s
cigarettes. “Which one was I, by the way?” he asked conversationally. “I forget.”

“Tailor. I was Beggarman.”

By then Smiley had had enough, so he slipped out, not bothering to say
goodbye. He got into his car and drove for an hour anywhere, till he found
himself on a side road to Oxford doing eighty, so he stopped for lunch and
headed back for London. He still couldn’t face Bywater Street, so he went to a
cinema, dined somewhere, and got home at midnight, slightly drunk, to find both

Lacon and Miles Sercombe on the doorstep, and Sercombe’s fatuous Rolls, the
black bedpan, all fifty feet of it, shoved up on the curb in everyone’s way.

They drove to Sarratt at a mad speed, and there, in the open night under a
clear sky, lit by several hand torches and stared at by several white-faced inmates
of the Nursery, sat Bill Haydon on a garden bench facing the moonlit cricket
field. He was wearing striped pyjamas under his overcoat; they looked more like
prison clothes. His eyes were open and his head was propped unnaturally to one
side, like the head of a bird when its neck has been expertly broken.

There was no particular dispute about what had happened. At ten-thirty
Haydon had complained to his guards of sleeplessness and nausea: he proposed
to take some fresh air. His case being regarded as closed, no one thought to
accompany him and he walked out into the darkness alone. One of the guards
remembered him making a joke about “examining the state of the wicket.” The
other was too busy watching the television to remember anything. After half an
hour they became apprehensive, so the senior guard went off to take a look while
his assistant stayed behind in case Haydon should return. Haydon was found
where he was now sitting; the guard thought at first that he had fallen asleep.
Stooping over him, he caught the smell of alcohol—he guessed gin or vodka—
and decided that Haydon was drunk, which surprised him since the Nursery was
officially dry. It wasn’t till he tried to lift him that his head flopped over, and the
rest of him followed as dead weight. Having vomited (the traces were over there
by the tree), the guard propped him up again and sounded the alarm.

Had Haydon received any messages during the day? Smiley asked.

No. But his suit had come back from the cleaners and it was possible a
message had been concealed in it—for instance inviting him to a rendezvous.

“So the Russians did it,” the Minister announced with satisfaction to Haydon’s
unresponsive form. “To stop him peaching, I suppose. Bloody thugs.”

“No,” said Smiley. “They take pride in getting their people back.”

“Then who the hell did?”

Everyone waited on Smiley’s answer, but none came. The torches went out
and the group moved uncertainly towards the car.

“Can we lose him just the same?” the Minister asked on the way back.

“He was a Soviet citizen. Let them have him,” said Lacon.

They agreed it was a pity about the networks. Better see whether Karla would
do the deal anyhow.

“He won’t,” said Smiley.

39

Recalling all this in the seclusion of his first-class compartment, Smiley had the
curious sensation of watching Haydon through the wrong end of a telescope. He
had eaten very little since last night, but the bar had been open for most of the
journey.

Leaving King’s Cross, he had had a wistful notion of liking Haydon and
respecting him: Bill was a man, after all, who had had something to say and had
said it. But his mental system rejected this convenient simplification. The more
he puzzled over Haydon’s rambling account of himself, the more conscious he
was of the contradictions. He tried at first to see Haydon in the romantic
newspaper terms of a thirties intellectual, for whom Moscow was the natural
Mecca. “Moscow was Bill’s discipline,” he told himself. “He needed the
symmetry of an historical and economic solution.” This struck him as too sparse,
so he added more of the man whom he was trying to like: “Bill was a romantic
and a snob. He wanted to join an elitist vanguard and lead the masses out of
darkness.” Then he remembered the half-finished canvases in the girl’s drawing¬
room in Kentish Town: cramped, over-worked, and condemned. He remembered
also the ghost of Bill’s authoritarian father—Ann had called him simply the
Monster—and he imagined Bill’s Marxism making up for his inadequacy as an
artist and for his loveless childhood. Later, of course, it hardly mattered if the
doctrine wore thin. Bill was set on the road and Karla would know how to keep
him there. Treason is very much a matter of habit, Smiley decided, seeing Bill
again stretched out on the floor in Bywater Street, while Ann played him music
on the gramophone.

Bill had loved it, too. Smiley didn’t doubt that for a moment. Standing at the
middle of a secret stage, playing world against world, hero and playwright in
one: oh. Bill had loved that, all right.

Smiley shrugged it all aside, distrustful as ever of the standard shapes of
human motive. He settled instead for a picture of one of those wooden Russian
dolls that open up, revealing one person inside the other, and another inside him.
Of all men living, only Karla had seen the last little doll inside Bill Haydon.
When was Bill recruited, and how? Was his right-wing stand at Oxford a pose,
or was it paradoxically the state of sin from which Karla summoned him to
grace?

Ask Karla: pity I didn’t.

Ask Jim: I never shall.

Over the flat East Anglian landscape as it slid slowly by, the unyielding face
of Karla replaced Bill Haydon’s crooked death mask. “But you had this one
price: Ann. The last illusion of the illusionless man. He reckoned that if I were
known to be Ann’s lover around the place you wouldn’t see me very straight
when it came to other things.”

Illusion? Was that really Karla’s name for love? And Bill’s?

“Here,” said the guard very loudly, and perhaps for the second time. “Come
on with it, you’re for Grimsby, aren’t you?”

“No, no—Immingham.” Then he remembered Mendel’s instructions and
clambered onto the platform.

There was no cab in sight, so, having enquired at the ticket office, he made his
way across the empty forecourt and stood beside a green sign marked “Queue.”
He had hoped she might collect him, but perhaps she hadn’t received his wire.

Ah well: the post office at Christmas: who could blame them? He wondered how
she would take the news about Bill; till, remembering her frightened face on the
cliffs in Cornwall, he realised that by then Bill was already dead for her. She had
sensed the coldness of his touch, and somehow guessed what lay behind it.

Illusion? He repeated to himself. Illusionless?

It was bitterly cold. He hoped very much that her wretched lover had found
her somewhere warm to live.

He wished he had brought her fur boots from the cupboard under the stairs.

He remembered the copy of Grimmelshausen, still uncollected at Martindale’s
club.

Then he saw her: her disreputable car shunting towards him down the lane
marked “Buses Only” and Ann at the wheel staring the wrong way. Saw her get
out, leaving the indicator winking, and walk into the station to enquire: tall and
puckish, extraordinarily beautiful, essentially another man’s woman.

For the rest of that term, Jim Prideaux behaved in the eyes of Roach much as his
mother had behaved when his father went away. He spent a lot of time on little
things, like fixing up the lighting for the school play and mending the soccer nets
with string, and in French he took enormous pains over small inaccuracies. But
big things, like his walks and solitary golf, he gave up altogether, and in the
evenings stayed in and kept clear of the village. Worst of all was his staring
empty look when Roach caught him unaware, and the way he forgot things in
class, even red marks for merit. Roach had to remind him to hand them in each
week.

To support him. Roach took the job of dimmer man on the lighting. Thus at
rehearsals Jim had to give him a special signal—to Bill and no one else. He was

to raise his arm and drop it to his side when he wanted the footlights to fade.

With time, Jim seemed to respond to treatment, however. His eye grew clearer
and he became alert again, as the shadow of his mother’s death withdrew. By the
night of the play, he was more light-hearted than Roach had ever known him.
“Hey, Jumbo, you silly toad, where’s your mac—can’t you see it’s raining?” he
called out as, tired but triumphant, they trailed back to the main building after
the performance. “His real name is Bill,” he heard him explain to a visiting
parent. “We were new boys together.”

The gun. Bill Roach had finally convinced himself, was, after all, a dream.
