Returning with a grunt of distaste to the unlovable table, Smiley resumed his
reading of Merlin’s progress since his own enforced retirement from the Circus.
The new regime of Percy Alleline, he at once noticed, had immediately produced
several favourable changes in Merlin’s life-style. It was like a maturing, a
settling down. The night dashes to European capitals ceased; the flow of
intelligence became more regular and less nervy. There were headaches,
certainly. Merlin’s demands for money—requirements, never threats—
continued, and with the steady decline in the value of the pound these large
payments in foreign currency caused the Treasury much agony. There was even
a suggestion at one point, never pursued, that “since we are the country of
Merlin’s choice, he should be ready to shoulder his portion of our financial
vicissitudes.” Haydon and Bland exploded, apparently: “I have not the face,”
wrote Alleline with rare frankness to the Minister, “to mention this subject to my
staff again.”

There was also a row about a new camera, which at great expense was broken
into tubular components by nuts and bolts section and fitted into a standard lamp
of Soviet manufacture. The lamp, after screams of pain—this time from the
Foreign Office—was spirited to Moscow by diplomatic bag. The problem was
then the drop. The residency could not be informed of Merlin’s identity, nor did
it know the contents of the lamp. The lamp was unwieldy, and would not fit the
boot of the resident’s car. After several shots, an untidy handover was achieved,
but the camera never worked and there was bad blood between the Circus and its
Moscow residency as a result. A less ambitious model was taken by Esterhase to
Helsinki, where it was handed—thus Alleline’s memo to the Minister—to “a
trusted intermediary whose frontier crossings would go unchallenged.”

Suddenly, Smiley sat up with a jolt.

“We spoke,” wrote Alleline to the Minister, in a minute dated February 27th
this year. “You agreed to submit a supplementary estimate to the Treasury for a
Eondon house to be carried on the Witchcraft budget.”

He read it once, then again more slowly. The Treasury had sanctioned sixty
thousand pounds for the freehold and another ten for furniture and fittings. To
cut costs, it wanted its own lawyers to handle the conveyance. Alleline refused
to reveal the address. For the same reason there was an argument about who
should keep the deeds. This time the Treasury put its foot down and its lawyers
drew up instruments to get the house back from Alleline should he die or go

bankrupt. But he still kept the address to himself, as also the justification for this
remarkable, and costly, adjunct to an operation that was supposedly taking place
abroad.

Smiley searched eagerly for an explanation. The financial files, he quickly
confirmed, were scrupulous to offer none. They contained only one veiled
reference to the London house, and that was when the rates were doubled:
Minister to Alleline: “I assume the London end is still necessary?” Adeline to
Minister: “Eminently. I would say more than ever. I would add that the circle of
knowledge has not widened since our conversation.” What knowledge?

It was not till he went back to the files which appraised the Witchcraft product
that he came on the solution. The house was paid for in late March. Occupancy
followed immediately. From the same date exactly. Merlin began to acquire a
personality, and it was shaped here in the customers’ comments. Till now, to
Smiley’s suspicious eye. Merlin had been a machine: faultless in tradecraft, eerie
in access, free of the strains that make most agents such hard going. Now,
suddenly, he was having a tantrum.

“We put to Merlin your follow-up question about the prevailing Kremlin view
on the sale of Russian oil surpluses to the United States. We suggested to him, at
your request, that this was at odds with his report last month that the Kremlin is
presently flirting with the Tanaka government for a contract to sell Siberian oil
on the Japanese market. Merlin saw no contradiction in the two reports and
declined to forecast which market might ultimately be favoured.”

Whitehall regretted its temerity.

“Merlin will not, repeat not, add to his report on the repression of Georgian
nationalism and the rioting in Tbilisi. Not being himself a Georgian, he takes the
traditional Russian view that all Georgians are thieves and vagabonds, and better
behind bars ...”

Whitehall agreed not to press.

Merlin had suddenly drawn nearer. Was it only the acquisition of a London
house that gave Smiley this new sense of Merlin’s physical proximity? From the
remote stillness of a Moscow winter. Merlin seemed suddenly to be sitting here
before him in the tattered room; in the street outside his window, waiting in the
rain, where now and then, he knew, Mendel kept his solitary guard. Here out of
the blue was a Merlin who talked and answered back and gratuitously offered his
opinions, a Merlin who had time to be met. Met here in Fondon? Fed,
entertained, debriefed in a sixty-thousand-pound house while he threw his
weight about and made jokes about Georgians? What was this circle of
knowledge that had now formed itself even within the wider circle of those
initiated into the secrets of the Witchcraft operation?

At this point, an improbable figure flitted across the stage: one J.P.R., a new
recruit to Whitehall’s growing band of Witchcraft evaluators. Consulting the
indoctrination list, Smiley established that his full name was Ribble, and that he
was a member of Foreign Office Research Department. J. R Ribble was puzzled.

J.RR. to the Adriatic Working Party (A.W.P.): “May I respectfully draw your
attention to an apparent discrepancy concerning dates? Witchcraft No. 104
(Soviet-French discussions on joint aircraft production) is dated April 21st.
According to your covering minute. Merlin had this information directly from
General Markov on the day after the negotiating parties agreed to a secret
exchange of notes. But on that day, April 21st, according to our Paris Embassy,
Markov was still in Paris, and Merlin, as witness your Report No. 109, was
himself visiting a missile research establishment outside Leningrad . . .”

The minute cited no fewer than four similar “discrepancies,” which, put
together, suggested a degree of mobility in Merlin that would have done credit to
his miraculous namesake.

J. P. Ribble was told in as many words to mind his own business. But in a
separate minute to the Minister, Alleline made an extraordinary admission that
shed an entirely new light on the nature of the Witchcraft operation.

“Extremely secret and personal. We spoke. Merlin, as you have known for
some time, is not one source but several. While we have done our best for
security reasons to disguise this fact from your readers, the sheer volume of
material makes it increasingly difficult to continue with this fiction. Might it not
be time to come clean, at least on a limited basis? By the same token it would do
the Treasury no harm to learn that Merlin’s ten thousand Swiss francs a month in
salary, and a similar figure for expenses and running costs, are scarcely
excessive when the cloth has to be cut so many ways.”

But the minute ended on a harsher note: “Nevertheless, even if we agree to
open the door this far, I regard it as paramount that knowledge of the existence
of the London house, and the purpose for which it is used, remain absolutely at a
minimum. Indeed, once Merlin’s plurality is published among our readers, the
delicacy of the London operation is increased.”

Totally mystified, Smiley read this correspondence several times. Then, as if
struck by a sudden thought, he looked up, his face a picture of confusion. So far
away were his thoughts, indeed, so intense and complex, that the telephone rang
several times inside the room before he responded to the summons. Lifting the
receiver, he glanced at his watch; it was six in the evening; he had been reading
barely an hour.

“Mr. Barraclough? This is Lofthouse from finance, sir.”

Peter Guillam, using the emergency procedure, was asking by means of the

agreed phrases for a crash meeting, and he sounded shaken.
