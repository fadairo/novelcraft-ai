There are old men who go back to Oxford and find their youth beckoning to
them from the stones. Smiley was not one of them. Ten years ago he might have
felt a pull. Not now. Passing the Bodleian, he vaguely thought, I worked there.
Seeing the house of his old tutor in Parks Road, he remembered that before the
war in its long garden Jebedee had first suggested he might care to talk to “one
or two people I know in London.” And hearing Tom Tower strike the evening
six, he found himself thinking of Bill Haydon and Jim Prideaux, who must have
arrived here the year that he went down, and were then gathered up by the war;
and he wondered idly how they must have looked together then; Bill, the painter,
polemicist, and socialite; Jim, the athlete, hanging on his words. In their heyday
together in the Circus, he reflected, that distinction had all but evened out: Jim
grew nimble at the brainwork and Bill in the field was no man’s fool. Only at the
end, the old polarity asserted itself: the workhorse went back to his stable, the
thinker to his desk.

Spots of rain were falling but he couldn’t see them. He had travelled by rail
and walked from the station, making detours all the way: Blackwell’s, his old
college, anywhere, then north. Dusk had come here early because of the trees.

Reaching a cul-de-sac, he once more dawdled, once more took stock. A
woman in a shawl rode past him on a push-bike, gliding through the beams of
the streetlamps where they pierced the swathes of mist. Dismounting, she pulled
open a gate and vanished. Across the road a muffled figure was walking a dog—
man or woman, he couldn’t tell. Otherwise the road was empty, so was the phone
box. Then abruptly two men passed him, talking loudly about God and war. The
younger one did most of the talking. Hearing the older one agree, Smiley
supposed he was the don.

He was following a high paling that bulged with shrubs. The gate of number
15 was soft on its hinges, a double gate but only one side used. When he pushed
it, the latch was broken. The house stood a long way back; most of the windows
were lit. In one, high up, a young man stooped over a desk. At another, two girls
seemed to be arguing; at a third, a very pale woman was playing the viola but he
couldn’t hear the sound. The ground-floor windows were also lit but the curtains
were drawn. The porch was tiled, the front door panelled with stained glass; on
the jamb was pinned an old notice: “After 11 P.M. use side door only.” Over the
bells, more notices: “Prince, three rings,” “Lumby, two rings,” “Buzz: out all
evening, see you, Janet.” The bottom bell said “Sachs” and he pressed it. At once

dogs barked and a woman started yelling.

“Flush, you stupid boy, it’s only a dunderhead. Flush, shut up, you fool.
Flush!”

The door opened part way, held on a chain; a body swelled into the opening.
While Smiley in the same instant gave his whole effort to seeing who else was
inside the house, two shrewd eyes, wet like a baby’s, appraised him, noted his
briefcase and his spattered shoes, flickered upward to peer past his shoulder
down the drive, then once more looked him over. Finally the white face broke
into a charming smile, and Miss Connie Sachs, formerly queen of research at the
Circus, registered her spontaneous joy.

“George Smiley,” she cried, with a shy trailing laugh as she drew him into the
house. “Why, you lovely darling man, I thought you were selling me a Hoover,
bless you, and all the time it’s George!”

She closed the door after him, fast.

She was a big woman, bigger than Smiley by a head. A tangle of white hair
framed her sprawling face. She wore a brown jacket like a blazer and trousers
with elastic at the waist and she had a low belly like an old man’s. A coke fire
smouldered in the grate. Cats lay before it and a mangy grey spaniel, too fat to
move, lounged on the divan. On a trolley were the tins she ate from and the
bottles she drank from. From the same adapter she drew power for her radio, her
electric ring, and her curling tongs. A boy with shoulder-length hair lay on the
floor, making toast. Seeing Smiley, he put down his brass trident.

“Oh, Jingle, darling, could it be tomorrow?” Connie implored. “It’s not often
my oldest, oldest lover comes to see me.” He had forgotten her voice. She played
with it constantly, pitching it at all odd levels. “I’ll give you a whole free hour,
dear, all to himself: will you? One of my dunderheads,” she explained to Smiley,
long before the boy was out of earshot. “I still teach, I don’t know why.

George, ” she murmured, watching him proudly across the room as he took the
sherry bottle from his briefcase and filled two glasses. “Of all the lovely darling
men I ever knew. He walked, ” she explained to the spaniel. “Look at his boots.
Walked all the way from London, didn’t you, George? Oh, bless, God bless.”

It was hard for her to drink. Her arthritic fingers were turned downward, as if
they had all been broken in the same accident, and her arm was stiff. “Did you
walk alone, George?” she asked, fishing a loose cigarette from her blazer pocket.
“Not accompanied, were we?”

He lit the cigarette for her and she held it like a peashooter, fingers along the
top, then watched him down the line of it with her shrewd, pinkish eyes. “So
what does he want from Connie, you bad boy?”

“Her memory.”

“What part?”

“We’re going back over some old ground.”

“Hear that, Flush?” she yelled to the spaniel. “First they chuck us out with an
old bone, then they come begging to us. Which ground, George?”

“I’ve brought a letter for you from Lacon. He’ll be at his club this evening at
seven. If you’re worried, you’re to call him from the phone box down the road.
I’d prefer you not to do that, but if you must he’ll make the necessary impressive
noises.”

She had been holding him, but now her hands flopped to her sides and for a
good while she floated round the room, knowing the places to rest and the holds
to steady her, and cursing, “Oh, damn George Smiley and all who sail in him.”
At the window, perhaps out of habit, she parted the edge of the curtain but there
seemed to be nothing to distract her.

“Oh, George, damn you so,” she muttered. “How could you let a Lacon in?
Might as well let in the competition, while you’re about it.”

On the table lay a copy of the day’s Times, crossword uppermost. Each square
was inked in laboured letters. There were no blanks.

“Went to the soccer today,” she sang from the dark under the stairs as she
cheered herself up from the trolley. “Lovely Will took me. My favourite
dunderhead, wasn’t that super of him?” Her little-girl voice; it went with an
outrageous pout: “Gonnie got cold, George. Froze solid, Gonnie did, toes an’
all.”

He guessed she was crying, so he fetched her from the dark and led her to the
sofa. Her glass was empty and he filled it half. Side by side on the sofa, they
drank while Gonnie’s tears ran down her blazer onto his hands.

“Oh, George,” she said. “Do you know what she told me when they threw me
out? That personnel cow?” She was holding one point of Smiley’s collar,
working it between her finger and thumb while she cheered up. “You know what
the cow said?” Her sergeant-major voice: “ 'You’re losing your sense of
proportion, Gonnie. It’s time you got out into the real world.’ I hate the real
world, George. I like the Gircus and all my lovely boys.” She took his hands,
trying to interlace her fingers with his.

“Polyakov,” he said quietly, pronouncing it in accordance with Tarr’s
instruction. “Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, cultural attache, Soviet
Embassy, London. He’s come alive again, just as you predicted.”

A car was drawing up in the road; he heard only the sound of the wheels, the
engine was already switched off. Then footsteps, very lightly.

“Janet, smuggling in her boyfriend,” Connie whispered, her pink-rimmed eyes
fixed on his while she shared his distraction. “She thinks I don’t know. Hear
that? Metal quarters on his heels. Now, wait.” The footsteps stopped, there was a
small scuffle. “She’s giving him the key. He thinks he works it more quietly than
she can. He can’t.” The lock turned with a heavy snap. “Oh, you men,” Connie
breathed with a hopeless smile. “Oh, George. Why do you have to drag up
Aleks?” And for a while she wept for Aleks Polyakov.

Her brothers were dons, Smiley remembered; her father was a professor of
something. Control had met her at bridge and invented a job for her.

She began her story like a fairy-tale: “Once upon a time, there was a defector
called Stanley, way back in 1963,” and she applied to it the same spurious logic
—part inspiration, part intellectual opportunism—born of a wonderful mind that
had never grown up. Her formless white face took on the grandmother’s glow of
enchanted reminiscence. Her memory was as compendious as her body and
surely she loved it more, for she had put everything aside to listen to it: her
drink, her cigarette, even for a while Smiley’s passive hand. She sat no longer
slouched but strictly, her big head to one side as she dreamily plucked the white
wool of her hair. He had assumed she would begin at once with Polyakov, but
she began with Stanley; he had forgotten her passion for family trees. Stanley,
she said; the inquisitors’ cover name for a fifth-rate defector from Moscow
Centre. March, 1963. The scalp-hunters bought him second-hand from the Dutch
and shipped him to Sarratt, and probably if it hadn’t been the silly season and if
the inquisitors hadn’t happened to have time on their hands—well, who knows
whether any of it would ever have come to light? As it was. Brother Stanley had
a speck of gold on him, one teeny speck, and they found it. The Dutch missed it
but the inquisitors found it, and a copy of their report came to Connie, “which
was a whole other miracle in itself,” Connie bellowed huffily, “considering that
everyone, and specially Sarratt, made an absolute principle of leaving research
off their distribution lists.”

Patiently Smiley waited for the speck of gold, for Connie was of an age where
the only thing a man could give her was time.

Now, Stanley had defected while he was on a mailfist job in The Hague, she
explained. He was by profession an assassin of some sort and had been sent to
Holland to murder a Russian emigre who was getting on Centre’s nerves.

Instead, he decided to give himself up. “Some girl had made a fool of him,” said
Connie with great contempt. “The Dutch set him a honey trap, my dear, and he
barged in with his eyes wide shut.”

To prepare him for the mission, Centre had posted him to one of their training
camps outside Moscow for a brush-up in the black arts: sabotage and silent
killing. The Dutch, when they had him, were shocked by this and made it the
focal point of their interrogation. They put his picture in the newspapers and had
him drawing pictures of cyanide bullets and all the other dreary weaponry Centre
so adored. But at the Nursery the inquisitors knew that stuff by heart, so they
concentrated on the camp itself, which was a new one, not much known: “Sort of
a millionaires’ Sarratt,” she explained. They made a sketch-plan of the
compound, which covered several hundred acres of forest and lakeland, and put
in all the buildings Stanley could remember: laundries, canteens, lecture huts,
ranges, all the dross. Stanley had been there several times and remembered a lot.
They thought they were about finished when Stanley went very quiet. He took a
pencil and in the north west corner he drew five more huts and a double fence
round them for the guard dogs, bless him. These huts were new, said Stanley,
built in the last few months. You reached them by a private road; he had seen
them from a hilltop when he was out walking with his instructor, Milos.
According to Milos (who was Stanley’s friend, said Connie with much
innuendo), they housed a special school recently founded by Karla for training
military officers in conspiracy.

“So, my dear, there we were,” Connie cried. “For years we’d been hearing
rumours that Karla was trying to build a private army of his own inside Moscow
Centre but, poor lamb, he hadn’t the power. We knew he had agents scattered
round the globe, and naturally he was worried that as he grew older and more
senior he wouldn’t be able to manage them alone. We knew that, like everyone
else, he was dreadfully jealous of them and couldn’t bear the idea of handing
them over to the legal residencies in the target countries. Well, naturally he
wouldn’t: you know how he hated residencies—overstaffed, insecure. Same as
he hated the old guard. 'Flat- earthers,’ he called them. Quite right. Well, now he
had the power and he was doing something about it, as any real man would.
March, 1963,” she repeated, in case Smiley had missed the date.

Then nothing, of course. “The usual game: sit on your thumbs, get on with
other work, whistle for a wind.” She sat on them for three years, until Major
Mikhail Fedorovich Komarov, assistant military attache in the Soviet Embassy in
Tokyo, was caught in flagrante taking delivery of six reels of top-secret
intelligence procured by a senior official in the Japanese Defence Ministry.
Komarov was the hero of her second fairy-tale: not a defector but a soldier with
the shoulder boards of the artillery.

“And medals, my dear! Medals galore!”

Komarov himself had to leave Tokyo so fast that his dog got locked in his flat
and was later found starved to death, which was something Connie could not
forgive him for. Whereas Komarov’s Japanese agent was, of course, duly
interrogated and by a happy chance the Circus was able to buy the report from
the Toka.

“Why, George, come to think of it, it was you who arranged the deal!”

With a quaint pout of professional vanity, Smiley conceded that it might well
have been.

The essence of the report was simple. The Japanese defence official was a
mole. He had been recruited before the war in the shadow of the Japanese
invasion of Manchuria, by one Martin Brandt, a German journalist who seemed
to be connected with the Comintern. Brandt, said Connie, was one of Karla’s
names in the nineteen-thirties. Komarov himself had never been a member of the
official Tokyo residency inside the Embassy; he’d worked solo, with one legman
and a direct line to Karla, whose brother officer he had been in the war. Better
still, before he arrived in Tokyo he had attended a special training course at a
new school outside Moscow set up specially for Karla’s handpicked pupils.
“Conclusion,” Connie sang. “Brother Komarov was our first and, alas, not very
distinguished graduate of the Karla training school. He was shot, poor lamb,”
she added, with a dramatic fall of her voice. “They never hang, do they: too
impatient, the little horrors.”

Now Connie had felt able to go to town, she said. Knowing what signs to look
for, she tracked back through Karla’s file. She spent three weeks in Whitehall
with the army’s Moscow-gazers combing Soviet Army posting bulletins for
disguised entries until, from a host of suspects, she reckoned she had three new,
identifiable Karla trainees. All were military men, all were personally acquainted
with Karla, all were ten to fifteen years his junior. She gave their names as
Bardin, Stokovsky, and Viktorov—all colonels.

At the mention of this third name, Smiley’s eyes turned very tired, as if he
were staving off boredom.

“So what became of them all,” he asked.

“Bardin changed to Sokolov, then Rusakov. Joined the Soviet Delegation to
the United Nations in New York. No overt connection with the local residency,
no involvement in bread-and-butter operations, no coat-trailing, no talent-
spotting—a good solid cover job. Still there, for all I know.”

“Stokovsky?”

“Went illegal, set up a photographic business in Paris as Grodescu, French
Rumanian. Formed an affiliate in Bonn, believed to be running one of Karla’s
West German sources from across the border.”

“And the third? Viktorov?”

“Sunk without trace.”

“Oh, dear,” said Smiley, and his boredom seemed to deepen.

“Trained and disappeared off the face of the earth. May have died, of course.
One does tend to forget the natural causes.”

“Oh, indeed,” Smiley agreed; “oh, quite.”

He had that art, from miles and miles of secret life, of listening at the front of
his mind; of letting the primary incidents unroll directly before him while
another, quite separate faculty wrestled with their historical connection. The
connection ran through Tarr to Irina, through Irina to her poor lover who was so
proud of being called Lapin, and of serving one Colonel Gregor Viktorov
“whose workname at the Embassy is Polyakov.” In his memory, these things
were like part of a childhood: he would never forget them.

“Were there photographs, Connie?” he asked glumly. “Did you land physical
descriptions at all?”

“Of Bardin at the United Nations, naturally. Of Stokovsky, perhaps. We had an
old press picture from his soldiering days, but we could never quite nail the
verification.”

“And of Viktorov, who sank without trace?” Still, it might have been any
name. “No pretty picture of him, either?” Smiley asked, going down the room to
fetch more drink.

“Viktorov, Colonel Gregor,” Connie repeated with a fond distracted smile.
“Fought like a terrier at Stalingrad. No, we never had a photograph. Pity. They
said he was yards the best.” She perked up: “Though, of course, we don’t know
about the others. Five huts and a two-year course: well, my dear, that adds up to
a sight more than three graduates after all these years!”

With a tiny sigh of disappointment, as if to say there was nothing so far in that
whole narrative, let alone in the person of Colonel Gregor Viktorov, to advance
him in his laborious quest, Smiley suggested they should pass to the wholly
unrelated phenomenon of Polyakov, Aleksey Aleksandrovich, of the Soviet
Embassy in London, better known to Connie as dear Aleks Polyakov, and
establish just where he fitted into Karla’s scheme of things and why it was that
she had been forbidden to investigate him further.
