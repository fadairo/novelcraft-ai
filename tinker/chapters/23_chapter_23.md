“It is the business of agent runners to turn themselves into legends,” Smiley
began, rather as if he were delivering a trainee lecture at the Nursery. “They do
this first to impress their agents. Later they try it out on their colleagues and, in
my personal experience, make rare asses of themselves in consequence. A few
go so far as to try it on themselves. Those are the charlatans and they must be got
rid of quickly, there’s no other way.”

Yet legends were made and Karla was one of them. Even his age was a
mystery. Most likely Karla was not his real name. Decades of his life were not
accounted for, and probably never would be, since the people he worked with
had a way of dying off or keeping their mouths shut.

“There’s a story that his father was in the Okhrana and later reappeared in the
Cheka. I don’t think it’s true but it may be. There’s another that he worked as a
kitchen boy on an armoured train against Japanese Occupation troops in the
East. He is said to have learnt his tradecraft from Berg—to have been his ewe
lamb, in fact—which is a bit like being taught music by ... oh, name a great
composer. So far as I am concerned, his career began in Spain in 1936, because
that at least is documented. He posed as a White Russian journalist in the Franco
cause and recruited a stable of German agents. It was a most intricate operation,
and for a young man remarkable. He popped up next in the Soviet counter¬
offensive against Smolensk in the autumn of 1941 as an intelligence officer
under Konev. He had the job of running networks of partisans behind the
German lines. Along the way he discovered that his radio operator had been
turned round and was transmitting radio messages to the enemy. He turned him
back and from then on played a radio game which had them going in all
directions.”

That was another part of the legend, said Smiley: at Yelnya, thanks to Karla,
the Germans shelled their own forward line.

“And between these two sightings,” he continued, “in 1936 and 1941, Karla
visited Britain; we think he was here six months. But even today we don’t know
—that’s to say, I don’t know—under what name or cover. Which isn’t to say
Gerald doesn’t. But Gerald isn’t likely to tell us, at least not on purpose.”

Smiley had never talked to Guillam this way. He was not given to confidences
or long lectures; Guillam knew him as a shy man, for all his vanities, and one
who expected very little of communication.

“In ’48-odd, having served his country loyally, Karla did a spell in prison and

later in Siberia. There was nothing personal about it. He simply happened to be
in one of those sections of Red army intelligence which, in some purge or other,
ceased to exist.”

And certainly, Smiley went on, after his post-Stalin reinstatement, he went to
America; because when the Indian authorities in the summer of ’55 arrested him
in Delhi on vague immigration charges, he had just flown in from California.
Circus gossip later linked him with the big treason scandals in Britain and the
States.

Smiley knew better: “Karla was in disgrace again. Moscow was out for his
blood, and we thought we might persuade him to defect. That was why I flew to
Delhi. To have a chat with him.”

There was a pause while the weary boy slouched over and enquired whether
everything was to their satisfaction. Smiley, with great solicitude, assured him
that it was.

“The story of my meeting with Karla,” he resumed, “belonged very much to
the mood of the period. In the mid-fifties, Moscow Centre was in pieces on the
floor. Senior officers were being shot or purged wholesale and its lower ranks
were seized with a collective paranoia. As a first result, there was a crop of
defections among Centre officers stationed overseas. All over the place—
Singapore, Nairobi, Stockholm, Canberra, Washington, I don’t know where—we
got this same steady trickle from the residencies: not just the big fish, but the
legmen, drivers, cypher clerks, typists. Somehow we had to respond—I don’t
think it’s ever realised how much the industry stimulates its own inflation—and
in no time I became a kind of commercial traveller, flying off one day to a
capital city, the next to a dingy border outpost—once even to a ship at sea—to
sign up defecting Russians. To seed, to stream, to fix the terms, to attend to
debriefing and eventual disposal.”

Guillam was watching him all the while, but even in that cruel neon glow
Smiley’s expression revealed nothing but a slightly anxious concentration.

“We evolved, you might say, three kinds of contract for those whose stories
held together. If the client’s access wasn’t interesting, we might trade him to
another country and forget him. Buy him for stock, as you would say, much as
the scalp-hunters do today. Or we might play him back into Russia—that’s
assuming his defection had not already been noticed there. Or, if he was lucky,
we took him; cleaned him of whatever he knew and resettled him in the West.
London decided, usually. Not me. But remember this. At that time Karla—or
Gerstmann, as he called himself—was just another client. I’ve told his story back
to front; I didn’t want to be coy with you, but you have to bear in mind now,
through anything that happened between us—or didn’t happen, which is more to

the point—that all I or anyone in the Circus knew when I flew to Delhi was that
a man calling himself Gerstmann had been setting up a radio link between
Rudnev, head of illegal networks at Moscow Centre, and a Centre-run apparatus
in California that was lying fallow for want of a means of communication. That’s
all. Gerstmann had smuggled a transmitter across the Canadian border and lain
up for three weeks in San Francisco breaking in the new operator. That was the
assumption, and there was a batch of test transmissions to back it up.”

For these test transmissions between Moscow and California, Smiley
explained, a book code was used: “Then, one day, Moscow signalled a straight
order—”

“Still on the book code?”

“Precisely. That is the point. Owing to a temporary inattention on the part of
Rudnev’s cryptographers, we were ahead of the game. The wranglers broke the
code and that’s how we got our information. Gerstmann was to leave San
Francisco at once and head for Delhi for a rendezvous with the Tass
correspondent, a talent-spotter who had stumbled on a hot Chinese lead and
needed immediate direction. Why they dragged him all the way from San
Francisco to Delhi, why it had to be Karla and no one else—well, that’s a story
for another day. The only material point is that when Gerstmann kept the
rendezvous in Delhi, the Tass man handed him an aeroplane ticket and told him
to go straight home to Moscow. No questions. The order came from Rudnev
personally. It was signed with Rudnev’s workname and it was brusque even by
Russian standards.”

Whereupon the Tass man fled, leaving Gerstmann standing on the pavement
with a lot of questions and twenty-eight hours until take-off.

“He hadn’t been standing there long when the Indian authorities arrested him
at our request and carted him off to Delhi jail. As far as I remember, we had
promised the Indians a piece of the product. I think that was the deal,” he
remarked and, like someone suddenly shocked by the faultiness of his own
memory, fell silent and looked distractedly down the steamy room. “Or perhaps
we said they could have him when we’d done with him. Dear, oh dear.”

“It doesn’t really matter,” Guillam said.

“For once in Karla’s life, as I say, the Circus was ahead of him,” Smiley
resumed, having taken a sip of wine and made a face. “He couldn’t know it but
the San Francisco network which he had just serviced had been rolled up hide
and hair the day he left for Delhi. As soon as Control had the story from the
wranglers, he traded it to the Americans on the understanding that they missed
Gerstmann but hit the rest of the Rudnev network in California. Gerstmann flew
on to Delhi unaware, and he was still unaware when I arrived at Delhi jail to sell

him a piece of insurance, as Control called it. His choice was very simple. There
could not be the slightest doubt, on present form, that Gerstmann’s head was on
the block in Moscow, where to save his own neck Rudnev was busy denouncing
him for blowing the San Francisco network. The affair had made a great splash
in the States, and Moscow was very angry at the publicity. I had with me the
American press photographs of the arrest, even of the radio set Karla had
imported and the signal plans he had cached before he left. You know how
prickly we all become when things get into the papers.”

Guillam did; and with a jolt remembered the Testify file, which he had left
with Mendel earlier that evening.

“To sum it up, Karla was the proverbial cold-war orphan. He had left home to
do a job abroad. The job had blown up in his face, but he couldn’t go back: home
was more hostile than abroad. We had no powers of permanent arrest, so it was
up to Karla to ask us for protection. I don’t think I had ever come across a
clearer case for defection. I had only to convince him of the arrest of the San
Francisco network—wave the press photographs and cuttings from my briefcase
at him—talk to him a little about the unfriendly conspiracies of Brother Rudnev
in Moscow, and cable the somewhat overworked inquisitors in Sarratt, and with
any luck I’d make London by the weekend. I rather think I had tickets for
Sadler’s Wells. It was Ann’s great year for ballet.”

Yes, Guillam had heard about that, too: a twenty-year-old Welsh Apollo, the
season’s wonder boy. They had been burning up London for months.

The heat in the jail was appalling, Smiley continued. The cell had an iron table
at the centre and iron cattle rings let into the wall. “They brought him manacled,
which seemed silly because he was so slight. I asked them to free his hands and
when they did, he put them on the table in front of him and watched the blood
come back. It must have been painful but he didn’t comment on it. He’d been
there a week and he was wearing a calico tunic. Red. I forget what red meant.
Some piece of prison ethic.” Taking a sip of wine, he again pulled a face, then
slowly corrected the gesture as the memories once more bore in upon him.

“Well, at first sight, he made little impression on me. I would have been hard
put to it to recognise in the little fellow before me the master of cunning we have
heard about in Irina’s diary, poor woman. I suppose it’s also true that my nerve-
ends had been a good deal blunted by so many similar encounters in the last few
months, by travel, and well by—well, by things at home.”

In all the time Guillam had known him, it was the nearest Smiley had ever
come to acknowledging Ann’s infidelities.

“For some reason, it hurt an awful lot.” His eyes were still open but his gaze
had fixed upon an inner world. The skin of his brow and cheeks was drawn

smooth as if by the exertion of his memory; but nothing could conceal from
Guillam the loneliness evoked by this one admission. “I have a theory which I
suspect is rather immoral,” Smiley went on, more lightly. “Each of us has only a
quantum of compassion. That if we lavish our concern on every stray cat, we
never get to the centre of things. What do you think of it?”

“What did Karla look like?” Guillam asked, treating the question as rhetorical.

“Avuncular. Modest, and avuncular. He would have looked very well as a
priest: the shabby, gnomic variety one sees in small Italian towns. Little wiry
chap, with silvery hair and bright brown eyes and plenty of wrinkles. Or a
schoolmaster, he could have been a schoolmaster: tough—whatever that means
—and sagacious within the limits of his experience; but the small canvas, all the
same. He made no other initial impression, except that his gaze was straight and
it fixed on me from early in our talk. If you can call it a talk, seeing that he never
uttered a word. Not one, the whole time we were together; not a syllable. Also it
was stinking hot and I was travelled to death.”

Out of a sense of manners rather than appetite, Smiley set to work on his food,
eating several mouthfuls joylessly before resuming his narrative. “There,” he
muttered, “that shouldn’t offend the cook. The truth is, I was slightly
predisposed against Mr. Gerstmann. We all have our prejudices and radio men
are mine. They’re a thoroughly tiresome lot, in my experience, bad fieldmen and
overstrung, and disgracefully unreliable when it comes down to doing the job.
Gerstmann, it seemed to me, was just another of the clan. Perhaps I’m looking
for excuses for going to work on him with less”—he hesitated—“less care, less
caution, than in retrospect would seem appropriate.” He grew suddenly stronger.
“Though I’m not at all sure I need make any excuses,” he said.

Here Guillam sensed a wave of unusual anger, imparted by a ghostly smile
that crossed Smiley’s pale lips. “To hell with it,” Smiley muttered.

Guillam waited, mystified.

“I also remember thinking that prison seemed to have taken him over very fast
in seven days. He had that white dust in the skin and he wasn’t sweating. I was,
profusely. I trotted out my piece, as I had a dozen times that year already, except
that there was obviously no question of his being played back into Russia as our
agent. 'You have the alternative. It’s no one else’s business but your own. Gome
to the West and we can give you, within reason, a decent life. After questioning,
at which you are expected to cooperate, we can help you to a new start, a new
name, seclusion, a certain amount of money. On the other hand, you can go
home and I suppose they’ll shoot you or send you to a camp. Last month they
sent Bykov, Shur, and Muranov. Now why don’t you tell me your real name?’
Something like that. Then I sat back and wiped away the sweat and waited for

him to say, 'Yes, thank you.’ He did nothing. He didn’t speak. He simply sat
there stiff and tiny under the big fan that didn’t work, looking at me with his
brown, rather jolly eyes. Hands out in front of him. They were very calloused. I
remember thinking I must ask him where he had been doing so much manual
labour. He held them—like this—resting on the table, palms upward and fingers
a little bent, as if he were still manacled.”

The boy, thinking that by this gesture Smiley was indicating some want, came
lumbering over, and Smiley again assured him that all was doubly well, and the
wine in particular was exquisite—he really wondered where they had it from; till
the boy left grinning with secret amusement and flapped his cloth at an adjoining
table.

“It was then, I think, that an extraordinary feeling of unease began to creep
over me. The heat was really getting to me. The stench was terrible and I
remember listening to the pat-pat of my own sweat falling onto the iron table. It
wasn’t just his silence; his physical stillness began to get under my skin. Oh, I
had known defectors who took time to speak. It can be a great wrench for
somebody trained to secrecy even towards his closest friends suddenly to open
his mouth and spill secrets to his enemies. It also crossed my mind that the
prison authorities might have thought it a courtesy to soften him up before they
brought him to me. They assured me they hadn’t, but of course one can never
tell. So at first, I put his silence down to shock. But this stillness—this intense,
watchful stillness—was a different matter. Specially when everything inside me
was so much in motion: Ann, my own heartbeats, the effects of heat and travel..

“I can understand,” said Guillam quietly.

“Can you? Sitting is an eloquent business; any actor will tell you that. We sit
according to our natures. We sprawl and straddle, we rest like boxers between
rounds, we fidget, perch, cross and uncross our legs, lose patience, lose
endurance. Gerstmann did none of those things. His posture was finite and
irreducible, his little jagged body was like a promontory of rock; he could have
sat that way all day, without stirring a muscle. Whereas I—” Breaking out in an
awkward, embarrassed laugh, Smiley tasted the wine again, but it was no better
than before. “Whereas I longed to have something before me—papers, a book, a
report. I think I am a restless person, fussy, variable. I thought so then, anyway. I
felt I lacked philosophic repose. Lacked philosophy, if you like. My work had
been oppressing me much more than I realised; till now. But in that foul cell I
really felt aggrieved. I felt that the entire responsibility for fighting the cold war
had landed on my shoulders. Which was tripe, of course; I was just exhausted
and a little bit ill.” He drank again.

“I tell you,” he insisted, once more quite angry with himself. “No one has any
business to apologise for what I did.”

“What did you do?” Guillam asked, with a laugh.

“So anyway there came this gap,” Smiley resumed, disregarding the question.
“Hardly of Gerstmann’s making, since he was all gap; so of mine, then. I had
said my piece; I had flourished the photographs, which he ignored—I may say,
he appeared quite ready to take my word for it that the San Francisco network
was blown. I restated this part, that part, talked a few variations, and finally I
dried up. Or, rather, sat there sweating like a pig. Well, any fool knows that if
ever that happens, you get up and walk out. Take it or leave it,’ you say. 'See
you in the morning’; anything. 'Go away and think for an hour.’

“As it was, the next thing I knew, I was talking about Ann.” He left no time
for Guillam’s muffled exclamation. “Oh, not about my Ann, not in as many
words. About his Ann. I assumed he had one. I had asked myself—lazily, no
doubt—what would a man think of in such a situation, what would I? And my
mind came up with a subjective answer: his woman. Is it called 'projection’ or
'substitution’? I detest those terms but I’m sure one of them applies. I exchanged
my predicament for his, that is the point, and as I now realise I began to conduct
an interrogation with myself—he didn’t speak, can you imagine? There were
certain externals, it is true, to which I pinned the approach. He looked connubial;
he looked like half a union; he looked too complete to be alone in all his life.
Then there was his passport, describing Gerstmann as married; and it is a habit
in all of us to make our cover stories, our assumed personae, at least parallel
with the reality.” He lapsed again into a moment of reflection. “I often thought
that. I even put it to Gontrol: we should take the opposition’s cover stories more
seriously, I said. The more identities a man has, the more they express the person
they conceal. The fifty-year-old who knocks five years off his age. The married
man who calls himself a bachelor; the fatherless man who gives himself two
children ... Or the interrogator who projects himself into the life of a man who
does not speak. Few men can resist expressing their appetites when they are
making a fantasy about themselves.”

He was lost again, and Guillam waited patiently for him to come back. For
while Smiley might have fixed his concentration upon Karla, Guillam had fixed
his on Smiley; and just then would have gone anywhere with him, turned any
corner, in order to remain beside him and hear the story out.

“I also knew from the American observation reports that Gerstmann was a
chain-smoker: Gamels. I sent out for several packs of them—'packs’ is the
American word?—and I remember feeling very strange as I handed money to a

guard. I had the impression, you see, that Gerstmann saw something symbolic in
the transaction of money between myself and the Indian. I wore a money belt in
those days. I had to grope and peel off a note from a bundle. Gerstmann’s gaze
made me feel like a fifth-rate imperialist oppressor.” He smiled. “And that I
assuredly am not Bill, if you like. Percy. But not I.” He called to the boy, in
order to send him away: “May we have some water, please? A jug and two
glasses? Thank you.” Again he picked up the story: “So I asked him about Mrs.
Gerstmann. I asked him: where was she? It was a question I would dearly have
wished answered about Ann. No reply but the eyes unwavering. To either side of
him, the two guards, and their eyes seemed so light by comparison. She must
make a new life, I said; there was no other way. Had he no friend he could count
on to look after her? Perhaps we could find methods of getting in touch with her
secretly? I put it to him that his going back to Moscow would do nothing for her
at all. I was listening to myself, I ran on, I couldn’t stop. Perhaps I didn’t want
to. I was really thinking of leaving Ann, you see; I thought the time had come.

To go back would be a quixotic act, I told him, of no material value to his wife
or anyone—quite the reverse. She would be ostracised; at best, she would be
allowed to see him briefly before he was shot. On the other hand, if he threw in
his lot with us, we might be able to trade her; we had a lot of stock in those days,
remember, and some of it was going back to Russia as barter; though why in
God’s name we should have used it up for that purpose is beyond me. Surely, I
said, she would prefer to know him safe and well in the West, with a fair chance
that she herself would join him, than shot or starving to death in Siberia? I really
harped upon her: his expression encouraged me. I could have sworn I was
getting through to him, that I had found the chink in his armour; when of course
all I was doing—all I was doing was showing him the chink in mine. And when
I mentioned Siberia, I touched something. I could feel it, like a lump in my own
throat; I could feel in Gerstmann a shiver of revulsion. Well, naturally I did,”
Smiley commented sourly; “since it was only recently that he had been made an
inmate. Finally, back came the guard with the cigarettes, armfuls of them, and
dumped them with a clatter on the iron table. I counted the change, tipped him,
and in doing so again caught the expression in Gerstmann’s eyes; I fancied I read
amusement there, but really I was no longer in a state to tell. I noticed that the
boy refused my tip; I suppose he disliked the English. I tore open a packet and
offered Gerstmann a cigarette. 'Gome,’ I said, 'you’re a chain-smoker, everyone
knows that. And this is your favourite brand.’ My voice sounded strained and
silly, and there was nothing I could do about it. Gerstmann stood up and politely
indicated to the warders that he would like to return to his cell.”

Taking his time, Smiley pushed aside his half-eaten food, over which white

flakes of fat had formed like seasonable frost.

“As he left the cell, he changed his mind and helped himself to a packet of
cigarettes and the lighter from the table—my lighter, a gift from Ann. To
George from Ann with all my love.’ I would never have dreamed of letting him
take it in the ordinary way; but this was not the ordinary way. Indeed I thought it
thoroughly appropriate that he should take her lighter; I thought it—Lord help
me—expressive of the bond between us. He dropped the lighter and the
cigarettes into the pouch of his red tunic, then put out his hand for handcuffs. I
said, 'Light one now, if you want.’ I told the guards, 'Let him light a cigarette,
please.’ But he didn’t make a movement. 'The intention is to put you on
tomorrow’s plane to Moscow unless we come to terms,’ I added. He might not
have heard me. I watched the guards lead him out, then returned to my hotel;
someone drove me—to this day I couldn’t tell you who. I no longer knew what I
felt. I was more confused and more ill than I would admit, even to myself. I ate a
poor dinner, drank too much, and ran a soaring temperature. I lay on my bed
sweating, dreaming about Gerstmann. I wanted him terribly to stay. Lightheaded
as I was, I had really set myself to keep him, to remake his life—if possible to
set him up again with his wife in idyllic circumstances. To make him free; to get
him out of the war for good. I wanted him desperately not to go back.” He
glanced up with an expression of self-irony. “What I am saying, Peter, is it was
Smiley, not Gerstmann, who was stepping out of the conflict that night.”

“You were ill,” Guillam insisted.

“Let us say tired. Ill or tired; all night, between aspirin and quinine and treacly
visions of the Gerstmann marriage resurrected, I had a recurring image. It was of
Gerstmann, poised on the sill, staring down into the street with those fixed
brown eyes, and myself talking to him, on and on, 'Stay, don’t jump, stay.’ Not
realising, of course, that I was dreaming of my own insecurity, not his. In the
early morning a doctor gave me injections to bring down the fever. I should have
dropped the case, cabled for a replacement. I should have waited before going to
the prison, but I had nothing but Gerstmann in mind; I needed to hear his
decision. By eight o’clock I was already having myself escorted to the
accommodation cells. He was sitting stiff as a ramrod on a trestle bench; for the
first time, I guessed the soldier in him, and I knew that, like me, he hadn’t slept
all night. He hadn’t shaved and there was a silver down on his jaw which gave
him an old man’s face. On other benches Indians were sleeping, and with his red
tunic and this silvery colouring he looked very white among them. He was
holding Ann’s lighter in his hands; the packet of cigarettes lay beside him on the
bench, untouched. I concluded that he had been using the night, and the forsworn
cigarettes, to decide whether he could face prison and interrogation, and death.

One look at his expression told me that he had decided he could. I didn’t beseech
him,” Smiley said, going straight on. “He would never have been swayed by
histrionics. His plane left in the mid-morning; I still had two hours. I am the
worst advocate in the world, but in those two hours I tried to summon all the
reasons I knew for his not flying to Moscow. I believed, you see, that I had seen
something in his face that was superior to mere dogma, not realising that it was
my own reflection. I had convinced myself that Gerstmann ultimately was
accessible to ordinary human arguments coming from a man of his own age and
profession and—well, durability. I didn’t promise him wealth and women and
Cadillacs and cheap butter; I accepted that he had no use for those things. I had
the wit by then, at least, to steer clear of the topic of his wife. I didn’t make
speeches to him about freedom—whatever that means—or the essential goodwill
of the West; besides, they were not favourable days for selling that story, and I
was in no clear ideological state myself. I took the line of kinship. 'Look,’ I said,
'we’re getting to be old men, and we’ve spent our lives looking for the
weaknesses in one another’s systems. I can see through Eastern values just as
you can see through our Western ones. Both of us, I am sure, have experienced
ad nauseam the technical satisfactions of this wretched war. But now your own
side is going to shoot you. Don’t you think it’s time to recognise that there is as
little worth on your side as there is on mine? Look,’ I said, 'in our trade we have
only negative vision. In that sense, neither of us has anywhere to go. Both of us
when we were young subscribed to great visions—’ Again I felt an impulse in
him—Siberia—I had touched a nerve. 'But not any more. Surely?’ I urged him
just to answer me this: did it not occur to him that he and I by different routes
might well have reached the same conclusions about life? Even if my
conclusions were what he would call unliberated, surely our workings were
identical? Did he not believe, for example, that the political generality was
meaningless? That only the particular in life had value for him now? That in the
hands of politicians grand designs achieve nothing but new forms of the old
misery? And that therefore his life, the saving of it from yet another meaningless
firing squad, was more important—morally, ethically more important—than the
sense of duty, or obligation, or commitment, or whatever it was that kept him on
this present path of self-destruction? Did it not occur to him to question—after
all the travels of his life—to question the integrity of a system that proposed
cold-bloodedly to shoot him down for misdemeanours he had never committed?

I begged him—yes, I did beseech him. I’m afraid; we were on the way to the
airport and he still had not addressed a word to me—I begged him to consider
whether he really believed; whether faith in the system he had served was
honestly possible to him at this moment.”

For a while now, Smiley sat silent.

“I had thrown psychology to the winds, such as I possess; tradecraft, too. You
can imagine what Control said. My story amused him, all the same; he loved to
hear of people’s weakness. Mine especially, for some reason.” He had resumed
his factual manner. “So there we are. When the plane arrived, I climbed aboard
with him and flew part of the distance: in those days it wasn’t all jet. He was
slipping away from me and I couldn’t do anything to stop him. I’d given up
talking but I was there if he wanted to change his mind. He didn’t. He would
rather die than give me what I wanted; he would rather die than disown the
political system to which he was committed. The last I saw of him, so far as I
know, was his expressionless face framed in the cabin window of the aeroplane,
watching me walk down the gangway. A couple of very Russian-looking thugs
had joined us and were sitting in the seats behind him, and there was really no
point in my staying. I flew home, and Control said: 'Well, I hope to God they do
shoot him,’ and restored me with a cup of tea. That filthy China stuff he drinks,
lemon jasmine or whatever; he sends out for it to that grocer’s round the corner. I
mean he used to. Then he sent me on three months’ leave without the option. I
like you to have doubts,’ he said. Tt tells me where you stand. But don’t make a
cult of them or you’ll be a bore.’ It was a warning. I heeded it. And he told me to
stop thinking about the Americans so much; he assured me that he barely gave
them a thought.”

Guillam gazed at him, waiting for the resolution. “But what do you make of
it?” he demanded, in a tone that suggested he had been cheated of the end. “Did
Karla ever really think of staying?”

“I’m sure it never crossed his mind,” said Smiley with disgust. “I behaved like
a soft fool. The very archetype of a flabby Western liberal. But I would rather be
my kind of fool than his, for all that. I am sure,” he repeated vigorously, “that
neither my arguments nor his own predicament at Moscow Centre would
ultimately have swayed him in the least. I expect he spent the night working out
how he would outgun Rudnev when he got home. Rudnev was shot a month
later, incidentally. Karla got Rudnev’s job and set to work reactivating his old
agents. Among them Gerald, no doubt. It’s odd to reflect that all the time he was
looking at me, he could have been thinking of Gerald. I expect they’ve had a
good laugh about it since.”

The episode had one other result, said Smiley. Since his San Francisco
experience, Karla had never once touched illegal radio. He cut it right out of his
handwriting. “Embassy links are a different matter. But in the field his agents
aren’t allowed to go near it. And he still has Ann’s cigarette lighter.”

“Yours,” Guillam corrected him.

“Yes. Yes, mine. Of course. Tell me,” he continued, as the waiter took away
his money, “was Tarr referring to anyone in particular when he made that
unpleasant reference to Ann?”

“Tm afraid he was. Yes.”

“The rumour is as precise as that?” Smiley enquired. “And it goes that far
down the line? Even to Tarr?”

“Yes.”

“And what does it say, precisely?”

“That Bill Haydon was Ann Smiley’s lover,” said Guillam, feeling that
coldness coming over him which was his protection when he broke bad news
such as: you’re blown; you’re sacked; you’re dying.

“Ah. I see. Yes. Thank you.”

There was a very awkward silence.

“And was there—is there a Mrs. Gerstmann?” Guillam asked.

“Karla once made a marriage with a girl in Leningrad, a student. She killed
herself when he was sent to Siberia.”

“So Karla is fireproof,” Guillam asked finally. “He can’t be bought and he
can’t be beaten?”

They returned to the car.

“I must say that was rather expensive for what we had,” Smiley confessed.
“Do you think the waiter robbed me?”

But Guillam was not disposed to chat about the cost of bad meals in England.
Driving again, the day once more became a nightmare to him, a milling
confusion of half-perceived dangers, and suspicions.

“So who’s Source Merlin?” he demanded. “Where could Alleline have had
that information from, if not from the Russians themselves?”

“Oh, he had it from the Russians all right.”

“But for God’s sake, if the Russians sent Tarr—”

“They didn’t. Nor did Tarr use the British passports, did he? The Russians got
it wrong. What Alleline had was the proof that Tarr had fooled them. That is the
vital message we have learned from that whole storm in a teacup.”

“So what the hell did Percy mean about 'muddying pools’? He must have
been talking about Irina, for heaven’s sake.”

“And Gerald,” Smiley agreed.

Again they drove in silence, and the gap between them seemed suddenly
unbridgeable.

“Look, I’m not quite there myself, Peter,” Smiley said quietly. “But nearly I
am. Karla’s pulled the Gircus inside out; that much I understand, so do you. But
there’s a last clever knot, and I can’t undo it. Though I mean to. And if you want

a sermon, Karla is not fireproof, because he’s a fanatic. And one day, if I have
anything to do with it, that lack of moderation will be his downfall.”

It was raining as they reached Stratford tube station; a bunch of pedestrians
was huddled under the canopy.

“Peter, I want you to take it easy from now on.”

“Three months without the option?”

“Rest on your oars a bit.”

Closing the passenger door after him, Guillam had a sudden urge to wish
Smiley good night or even good luck, so he leaned across the seat and lowered
the window and drew in his breath to call. But Smiley was gone. He had never
known anyone who could disappear so quickly in a crowd.

Through the remainder of that same night, the light in the dormer window of Mr.
Barraclough’s attic room at the Islay Hotel burned uninterrupted. Unchanged,
unshaven, George Smiley remained bowed at the Major’s card table, reading,
comparing, annotating, cross-referring—all with an intensity that, had he been
his own observer, would surely have recalled for him the last days of Control on
the fifth floor at Cambridge Circus. Shaking the pieces, he consulted Guillam’s
leave rosters and sick-lists going back over the last year, and set these beside the
overt travel pattern of Cultural Attache Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, his
trips to Moscow, his trips out of London, as reported to the Foreign Office by
Special Branch and the immigration authorities. He compared these again with
the dates when Merlin apparently supplied his information and, without quite
knowing why he was doing it, broke down the Witchcraft reports into those
which were demonstrably topical at the time they were received and those which
could have been banked a month, two months before, either by Merlin or his
controllers, in order to bridge empty periods: such as think pieces, character
studies of prominent members of the administration, and scraps of Kremlin tittle-
tattle which could have been picked up any time and saved for a rainless day.
Having listed the topical reports, he set down their dates in a single column and
threw out the rest. At this point, his mood could be best compared with that of a
scientist who senses by instinct that he is on the brink of a discovery and is
awaiting any minute the logical connection. Later, in conversation with Mendel,
he called it “shoving everything into a test-tube and seeing if it exploded.” What
fascinated him most, he said, was the very point that Guillam had made
regarding Alleline’s grim warnings about muddied pools: he was looking, in
other terms, for the “last clever knot” that Karla had tied in order to explain
away the precise suspicions to which Irina’s diary had given shape.

He came up with some curious preliminary findings. First, that on the nine

occasions when Merlin had produced a topical report, either Polyakov had been
in London or Toby Esterhase had taken a quick trip abroad. Second, that over the
crucial period following Tarr’s adventure in Hong Kong this year, Polyakov was
in Moscow for urgent cultural consultations; and that soon afterwards Merlin
came through with some of his most spectacular and topical material on the
“ideological penetration” of the United States, including an appreciation of
Centre’s coverage of the major American intelligence targets.

Backtracking again, he established that the converse was also true: that the
reports he had discarded on the grounds that they had no close attachment to
recent events were those which most generally went into distribution while
Polyakov was in Moscow or on leave.

And then he had it.

No explosive revelation, no flash of light, no cry of “Eureka,” phone calls to
Guillam, Eacon, “Smiley is a world champion.” Merely that here before him, in
the records he had examined and the notes he had compiled, was the
corroboration of a theory which Smiley and Guillam and Ricki Tarr had that day
from their separate points of view seen demonstrated: that between the mole
Gerald and the Source Merlin there was an interplay which could no longer be
denied; that Merlin’s proverbial versatility allowed him to function as Karla’s
instrument as well as Alleline’s. Or should he rather say, Smiley reflected—
tossing a towel over his shoulder and hopping blithely into the corridor for a
celebratory bath—as Karla’s agent? And that at the heart of this plot lay a device
so simple that it left him genuinely elated by its symmetry. It had even a physical
presence: here in Eondon, a house, paid for by the Treasury, all sixty thousand
pounds of it; and often coveted, no doubt, by the many luckless tax-payers who
daily passed it by, confident they could never afford it and not knowing that they
had already paid for it.

It was with a lighter heart than he had known for many months that he took up
the stolen file on Operation Testify.
