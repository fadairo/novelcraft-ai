Smiley sat in the Minister’s Rolls, with Lacon beside him. In Ann’s family the
car was called the black bedpan, and hated for its flashiness. The chauffeur had
been sent to find himself breakfast. The Minister sat in the front and everyone
looked forward down the long bonnet, across the river to the foggy towers of
Battersea Power Station. The Minister’s hair was full at the back, and licked into
small black horns around the ears.

“If you’re right,” the Minister declared, after a funereal silence. “I’m not
saying you’re not, but if you are, how much porcelain will he break at the end of
the day?”

Smiley did not quite understand.

“I’m talking about scandal. Gerald gets to Moscow. Right, so then what
happens? Does he leap on a soap-box and laugh his head off in public about all
the people he’s made fools of over here? I mean, Christ, we’re all in this
together, aren’t we? I don’t see why we should let him go just so’s he can pull
the bloody roof down over our heads and the competition sweep the bloody
pool.”

He tried a different tack. “I mean to say, just because the Russians know our
secrets, doesn’t mean everyone else has to. We got plenty of other fish to fry
apart from them, don’t we? What about all the black men: are they going to be
reading the gory details in the Walla Walla News in a week’s time?”

Or his constituents, Smiley thought.

“I think that’s always been a point the Russians accept,” said Lacon. “After
all, if you make your enemy look a fool, you lose the justification for engaging
him.” He added, “They’ve never made use of their opportunities so far, have
they?”

“Well, make sure they toe the line. Get it in writing. No, don’t. But you tell
them what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. We don’t go round
publishing the batting order at Moscow Centre, so they can bloody well play
ball, too, for once.”

Declining a lift, Smiley said the walk would do him good.

It was Thursgood’s day for duty and he felt it badly. Headmasters, in his opinion,
should be above the menial tasks; they should keep their minds clear for policy
and leadership. The flourish of his Cambridge gown did not console him, and as
he stood in the gymnasium watching the boys file in for morning line-up, his eye

fixed on them balefully, if not with downright hostility. It was Marjoribanks,
though, who dealt the death-blow.

“He said it was his mother,” he explained, in a low murmur to Thursgood’s
left ear. “He’d had a telegram and proposed to leave at once. He wouldn’t even
stay for a cup of tea. I promised to pass on the message.”

“It’s monstrous, absolutely monstrous,” said Thursgood.

“I’ll take his French, if you like. We can double up Five and Six.”

“I’m furious,” said Thursgood. “I can’t think. I’m so furious.”

“And Irving says he’ll take the rugger final.”

“Reports to be written, exams, rugger finals to play off. What’s supposed to be
the matter with the woman? Just a flu, I suppose, a seasonal flu. Well, we’ve all
got that, so have our mothers. Where does she live?”

“I rather gathered from what he said to Sue that she was dying.”

“Well, that’s one excuse he won’t be able to use again,” said Thursgood, quite
unmollified, and with a sharp bark quelled the noise and read the roll.

“Roach?”

“Sick, sir.”

That was all he needed to fill his cup. The school’s richest boy having a
nervous breakdown about his wretched parents, and the father threatening to
remove him.
