For the next two days George Smiley lived in limbo. To his neighbours, when
they noticed him, he seemed to have lapsed into a wasting grief. He rose late and
pottered round the house in his dressing gown, cleaning things, dusting, cooking
himself meals and not eating them. In the afternoon, quite against the local by¬
laws, he lit a coal fire and sat before it reading among his German poets or
writing letters to Ann, which he seldom completed and never posted. When the
telephone rang, he went to it quickly, only to be disappointed. Outside the
window the weather continued foul, and the few passers-by—Smiley studied
them continuously—were huddled in Balkan misery. Once Lacon called with a
request from the Minister that Smiley should “stand by to help clear up the mess
at Gambridge Gircus, were he called upon to do so”—in effect, to act as night
watchman till a replacement for Percy Alleline could be found. Replying
vaguely, Smiley prevailed on Lacon to take extreme care of Haydon’s physical
safety while he was at Sarratt.

“Aren’t you being a little dramatic?” Lacon retorted. “The only place he can
go is Russia, and we’re sending him there any way.”

“When? How soon?”

The details would take several more days to arrange. Smiley disdained, in his
state of anti-climactic reaction, to ask how the interrogation was progressing
meanwhile, but Lacon’s manner suggested that the answer would have been
“badly.” Mendel brought him more solid fare.

“Immingham railway station’s shut,” he said. “You’ll have to get out at
Grimsby and hoof it or take a bus.”

More often, Mendel simply sat and watched him, as one might an invalid.
“Waiting won’t make her come, you know,” he said once. “Time the mountain
went to Mohammed. Faint heart never won fair lady, if I may say so.”

On the morning of the third day, the doorbell rang and Smiley answered it so
fast that it might have been Ann, having mislaid her key as usual. It was Lacon.
Smiley was required at Sarratt, he said; Haydon insisted on seeing him. The
inquisitors had got nowhere and time was running out. The understanding was
that if Smiley would act as confessor, Haydon would give a limited account of
himself.

“I’m assured there has been no coercion,” Lacon said.

Sarratt was a sorry place after the grandeur that Smiley remembered. Most of
the elms had gone with the disease; pylons burgeoned over the old cricket field.

The house itself, a sprawling brick mansion, had also come down a lot since the
heyday of the cold war in Europe, and most of the better furniture seemed to
have disappeared, he supposed into one of Alleline’s houses. He found Haydon
in a Nissen hut hidden among the trees.

Inside, it had the stink of an army guardhouse, black-painted walls and high-
barred windows. Guards manned the rooms to either side and they received
Smiley respectfully, calling him “sir.” The word, it seemed, had got around.
Haydon was dressed in denims, he was trembling, and he complained of
dizziness. Several times he had to lie on his bed to stop the nosebleeds he was
having. He had grown a half-hearted beard: apparently there was a dispute about
whether he was allowed a razor.

“Cheer up,” said Smiley. “You’ll be out of here soon.”

He had tried, on the journey down, to remember Prideaux, and Irina, and the
Czech networks, and he even entered Haydon’s room with a vague notion of
public duty: somehow, he thought, he ought to censure him on behalf of right-
thinking men. He felt instead rather shy; he felt he had never known Haydon at
all, and now it was too late. He was also angry at Haydon’s physical condition,
but when he taxed the guards they professed mystification. He was angrier still
to learn that the additional security precautions he had insisted on had been
relaxed after the first day. When he demanded to see Craddox, head of Nursery,
Craddox was unavailable and his assistant acted dumb.

Their first conversation was halting and banal.

Would Smiley please forward the mail from his club, and tell Alleline to get a
move on with the horse-trading with Karla? And he needed tissues, paper tissues
for his nose. His habit of weeping, Haydon explained, had nothing to do with
remorse or pain; it was a physical reaction to what he called the pettiness of the
inquisitors, who had made up their minds that Haydon knew the names of other
Karla recruits, and were determined to have them before he left. There was also
a school of thought which held that Fanshawe, of the Christ Church Optimates,
had been acting as a talent-spotter for Moscow Centre as well as for the Circus,
Haydon explained. “Really, what can one do with asses like that?” He managed,
despite his weakness, to convey that his was the only level head around. They
walked in the grounds, and Smiley established with something close to despair
that the perimeter was not even patrolled any more, either by night or by day.
After one circuit, Haydon asked to go back to the hut, where he dug up a piece
of floorboard and extracted some sheets of paper covered in hieroglyphics. They
reminded Smiley forcibly of Irina’s diary. Squatting on the bed, he sorted
through them, and in that pose, in that dull light, with his long forelock dangling
almost to the paper, he might have been lounging in Control’s room, back in the

sixties, propounding some wonderfully plausible and quite inoperable piece of
skulduggery for England’s greater glory. Smiley did not bother to write anything
down, since it was common ground between them that their conversation was
being recorded anyway. The statement began with a long apologia, of which he
afterwards recalled only a few sentences.

“We live in an age where only fundamental issues matter ...

“The United States is no longer capable of undertaking its own revolution ...

“The political posture of the United Kingdom is without relevance or moral
viability in world affairs ...”

With much of it, Smiley might, in other circumstances, have agreed; it was the
tone, rather than the music, that alienated him.

“In capitalist America economic repression of the masses is institutionalised
to a point which not even Lenin could have foreseen ...

“The cold war began in 1917 but the bitterest struggles lie ahead of us, as
America’s death-bed paranoia drives her to greater excesses abroad ...”

He spoke not of the decline of the West, but of its death by greed and
constipation. He hated America very deeply, he said, and Smiley supposed he
did. Haydon also took it for granted that secret services were the only real
measure of a nation’s political health, the only real expression of its
subconscious.

Finally he came to his own case. At Oxford, he said, he was genuinely of the
right, and in the war it scarcely mattered where one stood as long as one was
fighting the Germans. For a while, after ’45, he said, he had remained content
with Britain’s part in the world, till gradually it dawned on him just how trivial
this was. How and when was a mystery. In the historical mayhem of his own
lifetime he could point to no one occasion; simply he knew that if England were
out of the game, the price of fish would not be altered by a farthing. He had
often wondered which side he would be on if the test ever came; after prolonged
reflection he had finally to admit that if either monolith had to win the day, he
would prefer it to be the East.

“It’s an aesthetic judgement as much as anything,” he explained, looking up.
“Partly a moral one, of course.”

“Of course,” said Smiley politely.

From then on, he said, it was only a matter of time before he put his efforts
where his convictions lay.

That was the first day’s take. A white sediment had formed on Haydon’s lips,
and he had begun weeping again. They agreed to meet tomorrow at the same
time.

“It would be nice to go into the detail a little, if we could. Bill,” Smiley said as

he left.

“Oh, and look—tell Jan, will you?” Haydon was lying on the bed, staunching
his nose again. “Doesn’t matter a hoot what you say, long as you make it final.”
Sitting up, he wrote out a cheque and put it in a brown envelope. “Give her that
for the milk bill.”

Realising, perhaps, that Smiley was not quite at ease with this brief, he added,
“Well, I can’t take her with me, can I? Even if they let her come, she’d be a
bloody millstone.”

The same evening, following Haydon’s instructions, Smiley took a tube to
Kentish Town and unearthed a cottage in an unconverted mews. A flat-faced fair
girl in jeans opened the door to him; there was a smell of oil paint and baby. He
could not remember whether he had met her at By water Street, so he opened
with “I’m from Bill Haydon. He’s quite all right but I’ve got various messages
from him.”

“Jesus,” said the girl softly. “About bloody time and all.”

The drawing-room was filthy. Through the kitchen door he saw a pile of dirty
crockery and he knew she used everything until it ran out, then washed it all at
once. The floorboards were bare except for long psychedelic patterns of snakes
and flowers and insects painted over them.

“That’s Bill’s Michelangelo ceiling,” she said conversationally. “Only he’s not
going to have Michelangelo’s bad back. Are you government?” she asked,
lighting a cigarette. “He works for government, he told me.” Her hand was
shaking and she had yellow smudges under her eyes.

“Oh, look, first I’m to give you that,” said Smiley, reaching in an inside
pocket, and handing her the envelope with the cheque.

“Bread,” said the girl, and put the envelope beside her.

“Bread,” said Smiley, answering her grin; then something in his expression, or
the way he echoed that one word, made her take up the envelope and rip it open.
There was no note, just the cheque, but the cheque was enough; even from where
Smiley sat, he could see it had four figures.

Not knowing what she was doing, she walked across the room to the fireplace
and put the cheque with the grocery bills in an old tin on the mantelpiece. She
went into the kitchen and mixed two cups of Nescafe, but she came out with
only one.

“Where is he?” she said. She stood facing him. “He’s gone chasing after that
snotty little sailor-boy again. Is that it? And this is the pay-off, is that it? Well,
you bloody tell him from me—”

Smiley had had scenes like this before, and now absurdly the old words came
back to him.

“Bill’s been doing work of national importance. I’m afraid we can’t talk about
it, and nor must you. A few days ago he went abroad on a secret job. He’ll be
away some while. Even years. He wasn’t allowed to tell anyone he was leaving.
He wants you to forget him. I really am most awfully sorry.”

He got that far before she burst out. He didn’t hear all she said, because she
was blurting and screaming, and when the baby heard her it started screaming,
too, from upstairs. She was swearing—not at him, not even particularly at Bill,
just swearing dry-eyed—and demanding to know who the hell, who the bloody
bloody hell believed in government any more? Then her mood changed. Round
the walls, Smiley noticed Bill’s other paintings, mainly of the girl; few were
finished, and they had a cramped, condemned quality by comparison with his
earlier work.

“You don’t like him, do you? I can tell,” she said. “So why do you do his dirty
work for him?”

To this question also there seemed no immediate answer. Returning to
Bywater Street, he again had the impression of being followed, and tried to
telephone Mendel with the number of a cab which had twice caught his eye, and
to ask him to make immediate enquiries. For once, Mendel was out till after
midnight: Smiley slept uneasily and woke at five. By eight he was back at
Sarratt, to find Haydon in a festive mood. The inquisitors had not bothered him;
he had been told by Craddox that the exchanges had been agreed and he should
expect to travel tomorrow or the next day. His requests had a valedictory ring:
the balance of his salary and the proceeds of any odd sales made on his behalf
should be forwarded to him care of the Moscow Narodny Bank, which would
also handle his mail. The Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol had a few pictures of his,
including some early water-colours of Damascus, which he coveted. Could
Smiley please arrange? Then, the cover for his disappearance:

“Play it long,” he advised. “Say I’ve been posted, lay on the mystery, give it a
couple of years, then run me down ...”

“Oh, I think we can manage something, thank you,” Smiley said.

For the first time since Smiley had known him, Haydon was worried about
clothes. He wanted to arrive looking like someone, he said; first impressions
were so important. “Those Moscow tailors are unspeakable. Dress you up like a
bloody beadle.”

“Quite,” said Smiley, whose opinion of Fondon tailors was no better.

Oh, and there was a boy, he added carelessly, a sailor friend, lived in Netting
Hill. “Better give him a couple of hundred to shut him up. Can you do that out of
the reptile fund?”

“I’m sure.”

He wrote out an address. In the same spirit of good fellowship, Haydon then
entered into what Smiley had called the details.

He declined to discuss any part of his recruitment or of his lifelong
relationship with Karla. “Lifelong?” Smiley repeated quickly. “When did you
meet?” The assertions of yesterday appeared suddenly nonsensical; but Haydon
would not elaborate.

From about 1950 onwards, if he was to be believed, Haydon had made Karla
occasional selected gifts of intelligence. These early efforts were confined to
what he hoped would directly advance the Russian cause over the American; he
was “scrupulous not to give them anything harmful to ourselves,” as he put it, or
harmful to our agents in the field.

The Suez adventure in ’56 finally persuaded him of the inanity of the British
situation, and of the British capacity to spike the advance of history while not
being able to offer anything by way of contribution. The sight of the Americans
sabotaging the British action in Egypt was, paradoxically, an additional
incentive. He would say therefore that from ’56 on, he was a committed, full¬
time Soviet mole with no holds barred. In 1961 he formally received Soviet
citizenship, and over the next ten years two Soviet medals—quaintly, he would
not say which, though he insisted that they were “top stuff.” Unfortunately,
overseas postings during this period limited his access; and since he insisted on
his information being acted upon wherever possible—“rather than being
chucked into some daft Soviet archive”—his work was dangerous as well as
uneven. With his return to London, Karla sent him Polly (which seemed to be the
house name for Polyakov) as a helpmate, but Haydon found the constant
pressure of clandestine meetings difficult to sustain, particularly in view of the
quantity of stuff he was photographing.

He declined to discuss cameras, equipment, pay, or tradecraft during this pre-
Merlin period in London, and Smiley was conscious all the while that even the
little Haydon was telling him was selected with meticulous care from a greater,
and perhaps somewhat different truth.

Meanwhile both Karla and Haydon were receiving signals that Control was
smelling a rat. Control was ill, of course, but clearly he would never willingly
give up the reins while there was a chance that he was making Karla a present of
the service. It was a race between Control’s researches and his health. Twice he
had very nearly struck gold—again Haydon declined to say how—and if Karla
had not been quick on his feet, the mole Gerald would have been trapped. It was
out of this nervy situation that first Merlin and finally Operation Testify were
born. Witchcraft was conceived primarily to take care of the succession: to put
Alleline next to the throne, and hasten Control’s demise. Secondly, of course.

Witchcraft gave Centre absolute autonomy over the product flowing into
Whitehall. Thirdly—and in the long run most important, Haydon insisted—it
brought the Circus into position as a major weapon against the American target.

“How much of the material was genuine?” Smiley asked.

Obviously the standard varied according to what one wanted to achieve, said
Haydon. In theory, fabrication was very easy: Haydon had only to advise Karla
of Whitehall’s areas of ignorance and the fabricators would write for them. Once
or twice, for the hell of it, said Haydon, he had written the odd report himself. It
was an amusing exercise to receive, evaluate, and distribute one’s own work.

The advantages of Witchcraft in terms of tradecraft were, of course, inestimable.
It placed Haydon virtually out of Control’s reach, and gave him a cast-iron cover
story for meeting Polly whenever he wished. Often months would pass without
their meeting at all. Haydon would photograph Circus documents in the
seclusion of his room—under cover of preparing Polly’s chicken-feed—hand it
over to Esterhase with a lot of other rubbish, and let him cart it down to the safe
house in Lock Gardens.

“It was a classic,” Haydon said simply. “Percy made the running, 1
slipstreamed behind him, Roy and Toby did the legwork.”

Here Smiley asked politely whether Karla had ever thought of having Haydon
actually take over the Circus himself: why bother with a stalking-horse at all?
Haydon stalled and it occurred to Smiley that Karla, like Control, might well
have considered Haydon better cast as a subordinate.

Operation Testify, said Haydon, was rather a desperate throw. Haydon was
certain that Control was getting very warm indeed. An analysis of the files he
was drawing produced an uncomfortably complete inventory of the operations
that Haydon had blown, or otherwise caused to abort. He had also succeeded in
narrowing the field to officers of a certain age and rank ...

“Was Stevcek’s original offer genuine, by the way?” Smiley asked.

“Good Lord, no,” said Haydon, actually shocked. “It was a fix from the start.
Stevcek existed, of course. He was a distinguished Czech general. But he never
made an offer to anyone.”

Here Smiley sensed Haydon falter. Lor the first time, he actually seemed
uneasy about the morality of his behaviour. His manner became noticeably
defensive.

“Obviously, we needed to be certain Control would rise, and how he would
rise ... and who he would send. We couldn’t have him picking some half-arsed
little pavement artist; it had to be a big gun to make the story stick. We knew
he’d only settle for someone outside the mainstream and someone who wasn’t
Witchcraft-cleared. If we made it a Czech, he’d have to choose a Czech speaker.

naturally.”

“Naturally.”

“We wanted old Circus: someone who could bring down the temple a bit.”

“Yes,” said Smiley, remembering that heaving, sweating figure on the hilltop.
“Yes, I see the logic of that.”

“Well, damn it, I got him back,” Haydon snapped.

“Yes, that was good of you. Tell me, did Jim come to see you before he left on
that Testify mission?”

“Yes, he did, as a matter of fact.”

“To say what?”

For a long, long while Haydon hesitated, then did not answer. But the answer
was written there, all the same: in the sudden emptying of his eyes, in the
shadow of guilt that crossed his face. He came to warn you, Smiley thought;
because he loved you. To warn you; just as he came to tell me that Control was
mad, but couldn’t find me because I was in Berlin. Jim was watching your back
for you right till the end.

Also, Haydon resumed, it had to be a country with a recent history of counter¬
revolution: Czecho was honestly the only place.

Smiley appeared not quite to be listening.

“Why did you bring him back?” he asked. “For friendship’s sake? Because he
was harmless and you held all the cards?”

It wasn’t just that, Haydon explained. As long as Jim was in a Czech prison
(he didn’t say Russian), people would agitate for him and see him as some sort
of key. But once he was back, everyone in Whitehall would conspire to keep him
quiet; that was the way of it with repatriations.

“I’m surprised Karla didn’t just shoot him. Or did he hold back out of delicacy
towards you?”

But Haydon had drifted away again into half-baked political assertions.

Then he began speaking about himself, and already, to Smiley’s eye, he
seemed visibly to be shrinking to something quite small and mean. He was
touched to hear that Ionesco had recently promised us a play in which the hero
kept silent and everyone round him spoke incessantly. When the psychologists
and fashionable historians came to write their apologias for him, he hoped they
would remember that that was how he saw himself. As an artist he had said all
he had to say at the age of seventeen, and one had to do something with one’s
later years. He was awfully sorry he couldn’t take some of his friends with him.
He hoped Smiley would remember him with affection.

Smiley wanted at that point to tell him that he would not remember him in
those terms at all, and a good deal more besides, but there seemed no point and

Haydon was having another nosebleed.

“Oh, I’m to ask you to avoid publicity, by the way. Miles Sercombe made
quite a thing of it.”

Here Haydon managed a laugh. Having messed up the Circus in private, he
said, he had no wish to repeat the process in public.

Before he left, Smiley asked the one question he still cared about.

“I’ll have to break it to Ann. Is there anything particular you want me to pass
on to her?”

It required discussion for the implication of Smiley’s question to get through
to him. At first, he thought Smiley had said “Jan,” and couldn’t understand why
he had not yet called on her.

“Oh, your Ann,” he said, as if there were a lot of Ann’s around.

It was Karla’s idea, he explained. Karla had long recognised that Smiley
represented the biggest threat to the mole Gerald. “He said you were quite
good.”

“Thank you.”

“But you had this one price: Ann. The last illusion of the illusionless man. He
reckoned that if I were known to be Ann’s lover around the place you wouldn’t
see me very straight when it came to other things.” His eyes, Smiley noticed, had
become very fixed. Pewtery, Ann called them. “Not to strain it or anything but, if
it was possible, join the queue. Point?”

“Point,” said Smiley.

For instance, on the night of Testify, Karla was adamant that if possible
Haydon should be dallying with Ann. As a form of insurance.

“And wasn’t there in fact a small hitch that night?” Smiley asked,
remembering Sam Collins and the matter of whether Ellis had been shot.

Haydon agreed that there had been. If everything had gone according to plan, the
first Czech bulletins should have broken at ten-thirty. Haydon would have had a
chance to read his club ticker-tape after Sam Collins had rung Ann, and before
he arrived at the Circus to take over. But because Jim had been shot, there was
fumble at the Czech end and the bulletin was released after his club had closed.

“Lucky no one followed it up,” he said, helping himself to another of Smiley’s
cigarettes. “Which one was I, by the way?” he asked conversationally. “I forget.”

“Tailor. I was Beggarman.”

By then Smiley had had enough, so he slipped out, not bothering to say
goodbye. He got into his car and drove for an hour anywhere, till he found
himself on a side road to Oxford doing eighty, so he stopped for lunch and
headed back for London. He still couldn’t face Bywater Street, so he went to a
cinema, dined somewhere, and got home at midnight, slightly drunk, to find both

Lacon and Miles Sercombe on the doorstep, and Sercombe’s fatuous Rolls, the
black bedpan, all fifty feet of it, shoved up on the curb in everyone’s way.

They drove to Sarratt at a mad speed, and there, in the open night under a
clear sky, lit by several hand torches and stared at by several white-faced inmates
of the Nursery, sat Bill Haydon on a garden bench facing the moonlit cricket
field. He was wearing striped pyjamas under his overcoat; they looked more like
prison clothes. His eyes were open and his head was propped unnaturally to one
side, like the head of a bird when its neck has been expertly broken.

There was no particular dispute about what had happened. At ten-thirty
Haydon had complained to his guards of sleeplessness and nausea: he proposed
to take some fresh air. His case being regarded as closed, no one thought to
accompany him and he walked out into the darkness alone. One of the guards
remembered him making a joke about “examining the state of the wicket.” The
other was too busy watching the television to remember anything. After half an
hour they became apprehensive, so the senior guard went off to take a look while
his assistant stayed behind in case Haydon should return. Haydon was found
where he was now sitting; the guard thought at first that he had fallen asleep.
Stooping over him, he caught the smell of alcohol—he guessed gin or vodka—
and decided that Haydon was drunk, which surprised him since the Nursery was
officially dry. It wasn’t till he tried to lift him that his head flopped over, and the
rest of him followed as dead weight. Having vomited (the traces were over there
by the tree), the guard propped him up again and sounded the alarm.

Had Haydon received any messages during the day? Smiley asked.

No. But his suit had come back from the cleaners and it was possible a
message had been concealed in it—for instance inviting him to a rendezvous.

“So the Russians did it,” the Minister announced with satisfaction to Haydon’s
unresponsive form. “To stop him peaching, I suppose. Bloody thugs.”

“No,” said Smiley. “They take pride in getting their people back.”

“Then who the hell did?”

Everyone waited on Smiley’s answer, but none came. The torches went out
and the group moved uncertainly towards the car.

“Can we lose him just the same?” the Minister asked on the way back.

“He was a Soviet citizen. Let them have him,” said Lacon.

They agreed it was a pity about the networks. Better see whether Karla would
do the deal anyhow.

“He won’t,” said Smiley.
