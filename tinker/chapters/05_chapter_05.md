“It happened around six months ago,” Tarr began.

“April,” Guillam snapped. “Just keep it precise, shall we, all the way along?”

“April, then,” Tarr said equably. “Things were pretty quiet in Brixton. I guess
there must have been half a dozen of us on standby. Pete Sembrini, he was in
from Rome; Cy Vanhofer had just made a hit in Budapest”—he gave a
mischievous smile—“Ping-Pong and snooker in the Brixton waiting room.
Right, Mr. Guillam?”

“It was the silly season.”

When out of the blue, said Tarr, came a flash requisition from Hong Kong
residency.

“They had a low-grade Soviet trade delegation in town, chasing up electrical
goods for the Moscow market. One of the delegates was stepping wide in the
nightclubs. Name of Boris; Mr. Guillam has the details. No previous record.
They’d had the tabs on him for five days, and the delegation was booked in for
fourteen more. Politically it was too hot for the local boys to handle but they
reckoned a crash approach might do the trick. The yield didn’t look that special,
but so what? Maybe we’d just buy him for stock—right, Mr. Guillam?”

Stock meant sale or exchange with another intelligence service: a commerce
in small-time defectors handled by the scalp-hunters.

Ignoring Tarr, Guillam said, “South East Asia was Tarr’s parish. He was
sitting around with nothing to do, so I ordered him to make a site inspection and
report back by cable.”

Each time someone else spoke, Tarr sank into a dream. His gaze settled upon
the speaker, a mistiness entered his eyes, and there was a pause like a coming
back before he began again.

“So I did what Mr. Guillam ordered,” he said. “I always do, don’t I, Mr.
Guillam? I’m a good boy really, even if I am impulsive.”

He flew the next night—Saturday, March 31st—with an Australian passport
describing him as a car salesman and with two virgin Swiss escape passports
hidden in the lining of his suitcase. These were contingency documents to be
filled in as circumstances demanded: one for Boris, one for himself. He made a
car rendezvous with the Hong Kong resident not far from his hotel, the Golden
Gate on Kowloon.

Here Guillam leaned over to Smiley and murmured, “Tufty Thesinger,
buffoon. Ex-major, King’s African Rifles. Percy Alleline’s appointment.”

Thesinger produced a report on Boris’s movements based on one week’s
surveillance.

“Boris was a real oddball,” Tarr said. “I couldn’t make him out. He’d been
boozing every night without a break. He hadn’t slept for a week and Thesinger’s
watchers were folding at the knees. All day he trailed round after the delegation,
inspecting factories, chiming in at discussions, and being the bright young Soviet
official.”

“How young?” Smiley asked.

Guillam threw in: “His visa application gave him born Minsk 1946.”

“Evening time, he’d go back to the Alexandra Lodge, an old shanty house out
on North Point where the delegation had holed out. He’d eat with the crew; then
around nine he’d ease out the side entrance, grab a taxi, and belt down to the
mainline night spots around Pedder Street. His favourite haunt was the Cat’s
Cradle in Queen’s Road, where he bought drinks for local businessmen and
acted like Mr. Personality. He might stay there till midnight. From the Cradle he
cut right down to Aberdeen Harbour, a place called Angelika’s, where the drink
was cheaper. Alone. It’s mainly floating restaurants and the big spenders down
there, but Angelika’s is a landbound cafe with a hellhole in the basement. He’d
have three or four drinks and keep the receipts. Mainly he drank brandy but now
and then he’d have a vodka to vary his diet. He’d had one tangle with a Eurasian
girl along the way, and Thesinger’s watchers got after her and bought the story.
She said he was lonely and sat on the bed moaning about his wife for not
appreciating his genius. That was a real breakthrough,” he added sarcastically as
Lacon noisily swooped on the little fire and stirred it, one coal against the other,
into life. “That night I went down to the Cradle and took a look at him.
Thesinger’s watchers had been sent to bed with a glass of milk. They didn’t want
to know.”

Sometimes as Tarr spoke, an extraordinary stillness came over his body, as if
he were hearing his own voice played back to him.

“He arrived ten minutes after me and he brought his own company, a big
blond Swede with a Chinese broad in tow. It was dark, so I moved into a table
nearby. They ordered Scotch, Boris paid, and I sat six feet away watching the
lousy band and listening to their conversation. The Chinese kid kept her mouth
shut and the Swede was doing most of the running. They talked English. The
Swede asked Boris where he was staying, and Boris said the Excelsior, which
was a damn lie because he was staying at the Alexandra Lodge with the rest of
the church outing. All right, the Alexandra is down the list; the Excelsior sounds
better. About midnight the party breaks up. Boris says he’s got to go home and
tomorrow’s a busy day. That was the second lie, because he was no more going

home than—what’s the one, Jekyll and Hyde, right!—the regular doctor who
dressed up and went on the razzle. So Boris was who?”

For a moment no one helped him.

“Hyde,” said Lacon to his scrubbed red hands. Sitting again, he had clasped
them on his lap.

“Hyde,” Tarr repeated. “Thank you, Mr. Lacon; I always saw you as a literary
man. So they settle the bill and I traipse down to Aberdeen to be there ahead of
him when he hits Angelika’s. By this time I’m pretty sure I’m in the wrong ball
game.”

On dry long fingers, Tarr studiously counted off the reasons: first, he never
knew a Soviet delegation that didn’t carry a couple of security gorillas whose job
was to keep the boys out of the fleshpots. So how did Boris slip the leash night
after night? Second, he didn’t like the way Boris pushed his foreign currency
around. For a Soviet official, that was against nature, he insisted: “He just
doesn’t have any damn currency. If he does, he buys beads for his squaw. And
three, I didn’t like the way he lied. He was a sight too glib for decency.”

So Tarr waited at the Angelika, and sure enough half an hour later his Mr.
Hyde turned up all on his own. “He sits down and calls for a drink. That’s all he
does. Sits and drinks like a damn wallflower!”

Once more it was Smiley’s turn to receive the heat of Tarr’s charm: “So what’s
it all about, Mr. Smiley? See what I mean? It’s little things I’m noticing,” he
confided, still to Smiley. “Just take the way he sat. Believe me, sir, if we’d been
in that place ourselves we couldn’t have sat better than Boris. He had the pick of
the exits and the stairway; he had a fine view of the main entrance and the
action; he was right-handed and he was covered by a left-hand wall. Boris was a
professional, Mr. Smiley; there was no doubt of it whatsoever. He was waiting
for a connect, working a letter-box, maybe, or trailing his coat and looking for a
pass from a mug like me. Well, now listen: it’s one thing to burn a small-time
trade delegate. It’s quite a different ball game to swing your legs at a Centre-
trained hood—right, Mr. Guillam?”

Guillam said, “Since the reorganisation, scalp-hunters have no brief to trawl
for double agents. They must be turned over to London Station on sight. The
boys have a standing order, over Bill Haydon’s own signature. If there’s even a
smell of the opposition, abandon.” He added, for Smiley’s special ear, “Under
lateralism our autonomy is cut to the bone.”

“And I’ve been in double-double games before,” Tarr confessed in a tone of
injured virtue. “Believe me, Mr. Smiley, they are a can of worms.”

“I’m sure they are,” said Smiley, and gave a prim tug at his spectacles.

Tarr cabled Guillam “no sale,” booked a flight home, and went shopping.

However, since his flight didn’t leave till Thursday, he thought that before he
left, just to pay his fare, he might as well burgle Boris’s room.

“The Alexandra’s a real ramshackle old place, Mr. Smiley, off Marble Road,
with a stack of wooden balconies. As for the locks—why, sir, they give up when
they see you coming.”

In a very short time, therefore, Tarr was standing inside Boris’s room with his
back against the door, waiting for his eyes to grow accustomed to the dark. He
was still standing there when a woman spoke to him in Russian drowsily from
the bed.

“It was Boris’s wife,” Tarr explained. “She was crying. Look, I’ll call her
Irina, right? Mr. Guillam has the details.”

Smiley was already objecting: wife was impossible, he said. Centre would
never let them both out of Russia at the same time; they’d keep one and send the
other—

“Common-law marriage,” Guillam said dryly. “Unofficial but permanent.”

“There’s a lot that are the other way round these days,” said Tarr with a sharp
grin at no one, least of all Smiley, and Guillam shot him another foul look.
