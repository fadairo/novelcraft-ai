Probably the only thing which Steve Mackelvore did wrong that same evening,
in terms of classic tradecraft, was blame himself for leaving the passenger door
of his car unlocked. Climbing in from the driver’s side, he put it down to his own
negligence that the other lock was up. Survival, as Jim Prideaux liked to recall,
is an infinite capacity for suspicion. By that purist standard, Mackelvore should
have suspected that in the middle of a particularly vile rush-hour, on a
particularly vile evening, in one of those blaring side streets that feed into the
lower end of the Elysees, Ricki Tarr would unlock the passenger door and hold
him up at gunpoint. But life in the Paris residency these days did little to keep a
man’s wits sharp, and most of Mackelvore’s working day had been taken up with
filing his weekly expenses and completing his weekly returns of staff for the
housekeepers. Only lunch, a longish affair with an insincere anglophile in the
French security labyrinth, had broken the monotony of that Friday.

His car, parked under a lime tree that was dying of exhaust fumes, had an
extraterritorial registration and “C.C.” plastered on the back, for the residency
cover was consular, though no one took it seriously. Mackelvore was a Circus
elder, a squat, white-haired Yorkshireman with a long record of consular
appointments which in the eyes of the world had brought him no advancement.
Paris was the last of them. He did not care particularly for Paris, and he knew
from an operational lifetime in the Far East that the French were not for him. But
as a prelude to retirement it could not be bettered. The allowances were good,
the billet was comfortable, and the most that had been asked of him in the ten
months he had been here was to welfare the occasional agent in transit, put up a
chalk-mark here and there, play postman to some ploy by Fondon Station, and
show a time to the visiting firemen.

Until now, that was, as he sat in his own car with Tarr’s gun jammed against
his rib-cage, and Tarr’s hand resting affectionately on his right shoulder, ready to
wrench his head off if he tried any monkey business. A couple of feet away, girls
hurried past on their way to the Metro, and six feet beyond that the traffic had
come to a standstill; it could stay that way for an hour. None was faintly stirred
by the sight of two men having a cosy chat in a parked car.

Tarr had been talking ever since Mackelvore sat down. He needed to send a
message to Alleline, he said. It would be personal and decypher yourself, and
Tarr would like Steve to work the machine for him while Tarr stood off with the
gun.

“What the hell have you been up to, Ricki?” Mackelvore complained, as they
walked arm in arm back to the residency. “The whole service is looking for you
—you know that, don’t you? They’ll skin you alive if they find you. We’re
supposed to do blood-curdling things to you on sight.”

He thought of turning into the hold and smacking Tarr’s neck, but he knew he
hadn’t the speed and Tarr would kill him.

The message would run to about two hundred groups, said Tarr, as
Mackelvore unlocked the front door and put on the lights. When Steve had
transmitted them, they would sit on the machine and wait for Percy’s answer. By
tomorrow, if Tarr’s instinct was correct, Percy would be coming over to Paris
hotfoot to have a conference with Ricki. This conference would also take place
in the residency, because Tarr reckoned it was marginally less likely that the
Russians would try to kill him on British consular premises.

“You’re berserk, Ricki. It’s not the Russians who want to kill you. It’s us.”

The front room was called Reception; it was what remained of the cover. It
had an old wooden counter and out-of-date “Notices to British Subjects”
hanging on the grimy wall. Here, with his left hand, Tarr searched Mackelvore
for a weapon but found none. It was a courtyard house and most of the sensitive
stuff was across the yard: the cypher-room, the strong-room, and the machines.

“You’re out of your mind, Ricki,” Mackelvore warned monotonously, as he
led the way through a couple of empty offices and pressed the bell to the cypher-
room. “You always thought you were Napoleon Bonaparte and now it’s got you
completely. You’d too much religion from your dad.”

The steel message hatch slid back and a mystified, slightly silly face appeared
in the opening. “You can go home, Ben, boy. Go home to your missus but stay
close to your phone in case I need you, there’s a lad. Leave the books where they
are and put the keys in the machines. I’ll be talking to London presently, under
my own steam.”

The face withdrew and they waited while the boy unlocked the door from
inside: one key, two keys, a spring lock.

“This gentleman’s from out East, Ben,” Mackelvore explained as the door
opened. “He’s one of my most distinguished connections.”

“Hullo, sir,” said Ben. He was a tall, mathematical-looking boy with
spectacles and an unblinking gaze.

“Get along with you, Ben. I’ll not dock it against your duty pay. You’ve the
weekend free on full rates, and you’ll not owe me time, either. Off you go, then.”

“Ben stays here,” said Tarr.

In Gambridge Gircus the lighting was quite yellow and from where Mendel

stood, on the third floor of the clothes shop, the wet tarmac glistened like cheap
gold. It was nearly midnight and he had been standing three hours. He stood
between a net curtain and a clothes-horse. He stood the way coppers stand the
world over: weight on both feet equally, legs straight, leaning slightly backward
over the line of balance. He had pulled his hat low and turned up his collar to
keep the white of his face from the street, but his eyes as they watched the front
entrance below him glittered like a cat’s eyes in a coal-hole. He would wait
another three hours or another six: Mendel was back on the beat; the scent of the
hunt was in his nostrils. Better still, he was a night bird; the darkness of that
fitting room woke him wonderfully. Such light as reached him from the street lay
upside down in pale pieces on the ceiling. All the rest—the cutting-benches, the
bolts of cloth, the draped machines, the steam iron, the signed photographs of
princes of the blood—these were there because he had seen them on his
reconnaissance that afternoon; the light did not reach them and even now he
could barely make them out.

From his window he covered most of the approaches: eight or nine unequal
roads and alleys that for no good reason had chosen Cambridge Circus as their
meeting point. Between them, the buildings were gimcrack, cheaply fitted out
with bits of Empire: a Roman bank, a theatre like a vast desecrated mosque.
Behind them, high-rise blocks advanced like an army of robots. Above, a pink
sky was slowly filling with fog.

Why was it so quiet? he wondered. The theatre had long emptied but why
didn’t the pleasure trade of Soho, only a stone’s throw from his window, fill the
place with taxis, groups of loiterers? Not a single fruit lorry had rumbled down
Shaftesbury Avenue on its way to Covent Garden.

Through his binoculars Mendel once more studied the building straight across
the road from him. It seemed to sleep even more soundly than its neighbours.

The twin doors of the portico were closed and no light was visible in the ground-
floor windows. Only on the fourth floor, out of the second window from the left,
a pale glow issued, and Mendel knew it was the duty officer’s room; Smiley had
told him. Briefly he raised the glasses to the roof, where a plantation of aerials
made wild patterns against the sky, then down a floor to the four blackened
windows of the radio section.

“At night everyone uses the front door,” Guillam had said. “It’s an economy
measure to cut down on janitors.”

In those three hours, only three events had rewarded Mendel’s vigil; one an
hour is not much. At half past nine a blue Ford Transit delivered two men
carrying what looked like an ammunition box. They unlocked the door for
themselves and closed it as soon as they were inside, while Mendel murmured

his commentary into the telephone. At ten o’clock the shuttle arrived; Guillam
had warned him of this, too. The shuttle collected hot documents from the
outstations and stored them for safekeeping at the Circus over the weekend. It
called at Brixton, Acton, and Sarratt, in that order, said Guillam, lastly at the
Admiralty, and it made the Circus by about ten. In the event, it arrived on the dot
of ten, and this time two men from inside the building came out to help unload;
Mendel reported that, too, and Smiley acknowledged with a patient “Thank
you.”

Was Smiley sitting down? Was he in the darkness like Mendel? Mendel had a
notion he was. Of all the odd coves he had known, Smiley was the oddest. You
thought, to look at him, that he couldn’t cross the road alone, but you might as
well have offered protection to a hedgehog. Funnies, Mendel mused. A lifetime
of chasing villains and how do I end up? Breaking and entering, standing in the
dark and spying on the Funnies. He’d never held with Funnies till he met Smiley.
Thought they were an interfering lot of amateurs and college boys; thought they
were unconstitutional; thought the best thing the Special Branch could do, for its
own sake and the public’s, was say “Yes, sir,” “No, sir” and lose the
correspondence. Come to think of it, with the notable exception of Smiley and
Guillam, that’s exactly what he thought tonight.

Shortly before eleven, just an hour ago, a cab arrived. A plain licensed London
hackney cab, and it drew up at the theatre. Even that was something Smiley had
warned him about: it was the habit within the service not to take taxis to the
door. Some stopped at Foyle’s, some in Old Compton Street or at one of the
shops; most people had a favourite cover destination and Alleline’s was the
theatre. Mendel had never seen Alleline, but he had their description of him and
as he watched him through the glasses he recognised him without a doubt, a big
lumbering fellow in a dark coat; he even noticed how the cabby pulled a bad
face at his tip and called something after him as Alleline delved for his keys.

The front door is not secured, Guillam had explained; it is only locked. The
security begins inside, once you have turned left at the end of the corridor.
Alleline lives on the fifth floor. You won’t see his windows light up but there’s a
skylight and the glow should catch the chimney-stack. Sure enough, as he
watched, a patch of yellow appeared on the grimy bricks of the chimney:

Alleline had entered his room.

And young Guillam needs a holiday, thought Mendel. He’d seen that happen
before, too: the tough ones who crack at forty. They lock it away, pretend it isn’t
there, lean on grown-ups who turn out not to be so grown up after all; then one
day it’s all over them, and their heroes come tumbling down and they’re sitting
at their desks with the tears pouring onto the blotter.

He had laid the receiver on the floor. Picking it up, he said, “Looks like
Tinker’s clocked in.”

He gave the number of the cab, then went back to waiting.

“How did he look?” Smiley murmured.

“Busy,” said Mendel.

“So he should be.”

That one won’t crack, though, Mendel decided with approval; one of your
flabby oak trees, Smiley was. Think you could blow him over with one puff, but
when it comes to the storm he’s the only one left standing at the end of it. At this
point in his reflections a second cab drew up, squarely at the front entrance, and
a tall slow figure cautiously climbed the steps one at a time, like a man who
takes care of his heart.

“Here’s your Tailor,” Mendel murmured into the telephone. “Hold on, here’s
Soldier-boy, too. Proper gathering of the clans, by the look of it. I say, take it
easy.”

An old Mercedes 190 shot out of Earlham Street, swung directly beneath his
window, and held the curve with difficulty as far as the northern outlet of the
Charing Cross Road, where it parked. A young heavy fellow with ginger hair
clambered out, slammed the door, and clumped across the street to the entrance
without even taking the key out of the dash. A moment later another light went
up on the fourth floor as Roy Bland joined the party.

All we need to know now is who comes out, thought Mendel.
