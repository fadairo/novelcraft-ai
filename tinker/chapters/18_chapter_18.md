Which left me Bill, thought Smiley. In the course of most London nights, there
is one respite from alarm. Ten, twenty minutes, thirty, even an hour, and not a
drunk groans or a child cries or a car’s tyres whine into a collision. In Sussex
Gardens it happens around three. That night it came early, at one, as Smiley
stood once more at his dormer window peering down like a prisoner at Mrs.

Pope Graham’s sand patch, where a Bedford van had recently parked. Its roof
was daubed with slogans: “Sydney 90 Days,” “Athens Non-Stop,” “Mary Lou
Here We Gome.” A light glowed inside, and he presumed some children were
sleeping there in unmarried bliss. “Kids,” he was supposed to call them. Gurtains
covered the windows.

Which left me Bill, he thought, still staring at the closed curtains of the van
and its flamboyant globe-trotting proclamations; which left me Bill, and our
friendly little chat in Bywater Street—^just the two of us, old friends, old
comrades-at-arms, “sharing everything,” as Martindale had it so elegantly, but
Ann sent out for the evening so that the men could be alone. “Which left me
Bill,” he repeated hopelessly, and felt the blood rise, and the colours of his vision
heighten, and his sense of moderation begin its dangerous slide.

Who was he? Smiley had no focus on him any more. Each time he thought of
him, he drew him too large, and different. Until Ann’s affair with him, he
thought he knew Bill pretty well, his brilliance and its limitations. He was of that
pre-war set that seemed to have vanished for good, which managed to be
disreputable and high-minded at the same time. His father was a high court
judge, two of his several beautiful sisters had married into the aristocracy; at
Oxford he favoured the unfashionable right rather than the fashionable left, but
never to the point of strain. From his late teens he had been a keen explorer and
amateur painter of brave, if over-ambitious, stamp; several of his paintings now
hung in Miles Sercombe’s fatuous palace in Garlton Gardens. He had
connections in every embassy and consulate across the Middle East and he used
them ruthlessly. He took up remote languages with ease, and when 1939 came,
the Gircus snapped him up; they had had their eye on him for years. He had a
dazzling war. He was ubiquitous and charming; he was unorthodox and
occasionally outrageous. He was probably heroic. The comparison with
Lawrence was inevitable.

And it was true, Smiley conceded, that Bill in his time had fiddled with
substantial pieces of history; had proposed all sorts of grand designs for restoring

England to influence and greatness—like Rupert Brooke, he seldom spoke of
Britain. But Smiley, in his rare moments of objectivity, could remember few that
ever got off the ground.

It was the other side of Haydon’s nature, by contrast, that as a colleague he
had found easier to respect: the slow-burning skills of the natural agent runner;
his rare sense of balance in the playing back of double agents and the mounting
of deception operations; his art of fostering affection, even love, though it ran
against the grain of other loyalties.

As witness, thank you, my wife.

Perhaps Bill really is out of scale, Smiley thought hopelessly, still grappling
for a sense of proportion. Picturing him now, and putting him beside Bland,
Esterhase, even Alleline, it did truthfully seem to Smiley that all of them were,
to a great or small extent, imperfect imitations of that one original, Haydon. That
their affectations were like steps towards the same unobtainable ideal of the
rounded man, even if the ideal was itself misconceived, or misplaced; even if
Bill was utterly unworthy of it. Bland in his blunt impertinence, Esterhase in his
lofty artificial Englishness, Alleline with his shallow gift of leadership—without
Bill they were a disarray. Smiley also knew, or thought he knew—the idea came
to him now as a mild enlightenment—that Bill in turn was also very little by
himself: that while his admirers (Bland, Prideaux, Alleline, Esterhase, and all the
rest of the supporters’ club) might find in him completeness. Bill’s real trick was
to use them, to live through them to complete himself, here a piece, there a
piece, from their passive identities, thus disguising the fact that he was less, far
less, than the sum of his apparent qualities ... and finally submerging this
dependence beneath an artist’s arrogance, calling them the creatures of his mind .

“That’s quite enough,” said Smiley aloud.

Withdrawing abruptly from this insight, dismissing it irritably as yet another
theory about Bill, he cooled his overheated mind with the recollection of their
last meeting.

“I suppose you want to grill me about bloody Merlin,” Bill began. He looked
tired and nervy; it was his time for commuting to Washington. In the old days he
would have brought an unsuitable girl and sent her to sit with Ann upstairs while
they talked their business; expecting Ann to bolster his genius to her, thought
Smiley cruelly. They were all of the same sort: half his age, bedraggled art
school, clinging, surly; Ann used to say he had a supplier. And once, to shock, he
brought a ghastly youth called Steggie, an assistant barman from one of the
Chelsea pubs, with an open shirt and a gold chain round his midriff.

“Well, they do say you write the reports,” Smiley explained.

“1 thought that was Bland’s job,” said Bill with his foxy grin.

“Roy makes the translations,” said Smiley. “You draft the covering reports;
they’re typed on your machine. The material’s not cleared for typists at all.”

Bill listened carefully, brows lifted, as if at any moment he might interrupt
with an objection or a more congenial topic, then hoisted himself from the deep
armchair and ambled to the bookcase, where he stood a full shelf higher than
Smiley. Fishing out a volume with his long fingers, he peered into it, grinning.

“Percy Alleline won’t do,” he announced, turning a page, “is that the
premise?”

“Pretty well.”

“Which means that Merlin won’t do, either. Merlin would do if he were my
source, wouldn’t he? What would happen if Bloody Bill here pottered along to
Control and said he’d hooked a big fish and wanted to play him alone? That’s
very nifty of you. Bill, boy,’ Control would say. 'You do it just the way you
want. Bill, boy—’course you do. Have some filthy tea.’ He’d be giving me a
medal by now, instead of sending you snooping round the corridors. We used to
be rather a classy bunch. Why are we so vulgar these days?”

“He thinks Percy’s on the make,” Smiley said.

“So he is. So am 1.1 want to be head boy. Did you know that? Time 1 made
something of myself, George. Half a painter, half a spy—time 1 was all
something. Since when was ambition a sin in our beastly outfit?”

“Who runs him. Bill?”

“Percy? Karla does—who else? Lower-class bloke with upper-class sources,
must be a bounder. Percy’s sold out to Karla; it’s the only explanation.” He had
developed the art, long ago, of deliberately misunderstanding. “Percy’s our
house mole,” he said.

“1 meant who runs Merlin? Who is Merlin? What’s going on?”

Leaving the bookcase, Haydon took himself on a tour of Smiley’s drawings.
“This is a Callot, isn’t it,” unhooking a small gilt frame and holding it to the
light, “it’s nice.” He tilted his spectacles to make them magnify. Smiley was
certain he had looked at it a dozen times before, “it’s very nice. Doesn’t anyone
think my nose should be out of joint? 1 am supposed to be in charge of the
Russian target, you know. Given it my best years, set up networks, talent-
spotters, all mod cons. You chaps on the fifth floor have forgotten what it’s like
to run an operation where it takes you three days to post a letter and you don’t
even get an answer for your trouble.”

Smiley, dutifully: Yes, 1 have forgotten. Yes, 1 sympathise. No, Ann is

nowhere in my thoughts. We are colleagues, after all, and men of the world; we
are here to talk about Merlin and Control.

“Along comes this upstart Percy, damn Caledonian street-merchant, no
shadow of class, shoving a whole wagonload of Russian goodies. Bloody
annoying, don’t you think?”

“Very.”

“Trouble is, my networks aren’t very good. Much easier to spy on Percy than
—” He broke off, tired of his own thesis. His attention had settled on a tiny van
Mieris head in chalk. “And I fancy this very much,” he said.

“Ann gave it me.”

“Amends?”

“Probably.”

“Must have been quite a sin. How long have you had it?”

Even now, Smiley remembered noticing how silent it was in the street.
Tuesday? Wednesday? And he remembered thinking: No, Bill. For you I have so
far received no consolation prize at all. As of this evening, you don’t even rate a
pair of bedroom slippers . . . Thinking but not saying.

“Is Control dead yet?” Haydon asked.

“Just busy.”

“What does he do all day? He’s like a hermit with the clap, scratching around
all on his own in that cave up there. All those bloody files he reads—what’s he
about, for God’s sake? Sentimental tour of his unlovely past. I’ll bet. He looks
sick as a cat. I suppose that’s Merlin’s fault, too, is it?”

Again Smiley said nothing.

“Why doesn’t he eat with the cooks? Why doesn’t he join us instead of
grubbing around for truffles up there? What’s he after?”

“I didn’t know he was after anything,” said Smiley.

“Ah, stop flirting around. Of course he is. I’ve got a source up there—one of
the mothers, didn’t you know? Tells me indiscretions for chocolate. Control’s
been toiling through personal dossiers of old Circus folk heroes, sniffing out the
dirt, who was pink, who was a queen. Half of them are under the earth already.
Making a study of all our failures. Can you imagine? And for why? Because
we’ve got a success on our hands. He’s mad, George. He’s got the big itch:
senile paranoia, take my word for it. Ann ever tell you about wicked Uncle Fry?
Thought the servants were bugging the roses to find out where he’d hidden his
money. Get away from him, George. Death’s a bore. Cut the cord, move down a
few floors. Join the proles.”

Ann had still not returned, so they sauntered side by side down the King’s
Road looking for a cab while Bill enunciated his latest vision of politics, and

Smiley said “Yes, Bill,” “No, Bill,” and wondered how he was going to break it
to Control. He forgot now which particular vision it was. The year before. Bill
had been a great hawk. He had wanted to run down conventional forces in
Europe and replace them outright with nuclear weapons. He was about the only
person left in Whitehall who believed in Britain’s independent deterrent. This
year, if Smiley remembered rightly. Bill was an aggressive English pacifist and
wanted the Sweden solution but without the Swedes.

No cab came; it was a beautiful night, and like old friends they went on
walking, side by side.

“By the by, if you ever want to sell that Mieris, let me know, will you? I’ll
give you a bloody decent price for it.”

Thinking Bill was making another bad joke, Smiley rounded on him, at last
prepared to be angry. Haydon was not even conscious of his interest. He was
gazing down the street, his long arm raised at an approaching cab.

“Oh, Christ, look at them,” he shouted irritably. “Full of bloody Jews going to
Quag’s.”

“Bill’s backside must look like a damn gridiron,” Control muttered next day,
barely looking up from his reading. “The years he’s spent sitting on the fence.”

For a moment he stared at Smiley in an unfocused way, as if looking through
him to some different, less fleshy prospect; then ducked his eyes and seemed to
resume his reading. “I’m glad he’s not my cousin,” he said.

The following Monday, the mothers had surprising news for Smiley. Control
had flown to Belfast for discussions with the army. Later, checking the travel
imprests, Smiley nailed the lie. No one in the Circus had flown to Belfast that
month, but there was a charge for a first-class return to Vienna and the issuing
authority was given as G. Smiley.

Haydon, also looking for Control, was cross: “So now what’s the pitch?
Dragging Ireland into the net, creating an organisational diversion, I suppose.
Jesus, your man’s a bore!”

The light in the van went out, but Smiley continued to gaze at its garish roof.
How do they live? he wondered. What do they do for water, money? He tried to
fathom the logistics of a troglodyte life in Sussex Gardens: water, drains, light.
Ann would work them out all right; so would Bill.

Facts. What were the facts?

Facts were that one balmy pre-Witchcraft summer evening, I returned
unexpectedly from Berlin to find Bill Haydon stretched on the drawing-room
floor and Ann playing Liszt on the gramophone. Ann was sitting across the room
from him in her dressing gown, wearing no make-up. There was no scene;

everyone behaved with painful naturalness. According to Bill, he had dropped
by on his way from the airport, having just flown in from Washington; Ann had
been in bed but insisted on getting up to receive him. We agreed it was a pity we
hadn’t shared a car from Heathrow. Bill left; I asked “What did he want?” And
Ann said: “A shoulder to cry on.” Bill was having girl trouble, wanted to pour
out his heart, she said.

“There’s Felicity in Washington, who wants a baby, and Jan in London, who’s
having one.”

“Bill’s?”

“God knows. I’m sure Bill doesn’t.”

Next morning, without even wishing to, Smiley established that Bill had been
back in London two days, not one. Following the episode. Bill showed an
uncharacteristic deference towards Smiley, and Smiley reciprocated with acts of
courtesy which normally belong to a newer friendship. In due course Smiley
noticed that the secret was out, and he was still mystified by the speed with
which that had happened. He supposed Bill had boasted to someone, perhaps
Bland. If the word was correct, Ann had broken three of her own rules. Bill was
Circus and he was Set—her word for family and ramifications. On either count
he would be out of bounds. Thirdly, she had received him at Bywater Street, an
agreed violation of territorial decencies.

Withdrawing once more into his own lonely life, Smiley waited for Ann to say
something. He moved into the spare room and arranged for himself plenty of
evening engagements in order that he would not be too aware of her comings
and goings. Gradually it dawned on him that she was deeply unhappy. She lost
weight, she lost her sense of play, and if he didn’t know her better he would have
sworn she was having a bad bout of the guilts, even of self-disgust. When he was
gentle with her, she fended him off; she showed no interest in Christmas
shopping and developed a wasting cough, which he knew was her signal of
distress. If it had not been for Operation Testify, they would have left for
Cornwall earlier. As it was, they had to postpone the trip till January, by which
time Control was dead, Smiley was unemployed, the scale had tipped; and Ann,
to his mortification, was covering the Haydon card with as many others as she
could pull from the pack.

So what happened? Did she break off the affair? Did Haydon? Why did she
never speak of it? Did it matter, anyway—one among so many? He gave up.

Like the Cheshire cat, the face of Bill Haydon seemed to recede as soon as he
advanced upon it, leaving only the smile behind. But he knew that somehow Bill
had hurt her deeply, which was the sin of sins.
