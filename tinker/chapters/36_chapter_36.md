Lock Gardens, which presumably drew its name from the Camden and
Hampstead Road Locks nearby, was a terrace of four flat-fronted nineteenth-
century houses built at the centre of a crescent, each with three floors and a
basement and a strip of walled back garden running down to the Regent’s Canal.
The numbers ran 2 to 5: number 1 had either fallen down or never been built.
Number 5 made up the north end, and as a safe house it could not have been
improved, for there were three approaches in thirty yards and the canal towpath
offered two more. To the north lay Camden High Street for joining traffic; south
and west lay the parks and Primrose Hill. Better still, the neighbourhood
possessed no social identity and demanded none. Some of the houses had been
turned into one-room flats, and had ten doorbells laid out like a typewriter. Some
were got up grandly and had only one. Number 5 had two: one for M i ll ie
McCraig and one for her lodger, Mr. Jefferson.

Mrs. McCraig was churchy and collected for everything, which was
incidentally an excellent way of keeping an eye on the locals, though that was
scarcely how they viewed her zeal. Jefferson, her lodger, was known vaguely to
be foreign and in oil and away a lot. Lock Gardens was his pied-a-terre. The
neighbours, when they bothered to notice him, found him shy and respectable.
They would have formed the same impression of George Smiley if they had
happened to spot him in the dim light of the porch at nine that evening, as Millie
McCraig admitted him to her front room and drew the pious curtains. She was a
wiry Scottish widow with brown stockings and bobbed hair and the polished,
wrinkled skin of an old man. In the interest of God and the Circus, she had run
Bible schools in Mozambique and a seaman’s mission in Hamburg, and though
she had been a professional eavesdropper for twenty years since then, she was
still inclined to treat all menfolk as transgressors. Smiley had no way of telling
what she thought. Her manner, from the moment he arrived, had a deep and
lonely stillness; she showed him round the house like a chatelaine whose guests
had long since died.

First the semi-basement, where she lived herself, full of plants and that
medley of old postcards, brass table-tops, and carved black furniture which
seems to attach itself to travelled British ladies of a certain age and class. Yes, if
the Circus wanted her at night they rang her on the basement phone. Yes, there
was a separate line upstairs, but it was only for outgoing calls. The basement
phone had an extension in the upstairs dining-room. Then up to the ground floor.

a veritable shrine to the costly bad taste of the housekeepers: loud Regency
stripes, gilded reproduction chairs, plush sofas with roped corners. The kitchen
was untouched and squalid. Beyond it lay a glass outhouse, half conservatory,
half scullery, which looked down to the rough garden and the canal. Strewn over
the tiled floor: an old mangle, a copper tub, and crates of tonic water.

“Where are the mikes, Millie?” Smiley had returned to the drawing-room.

They were in pairs, Millie murmured, bedded behind the wallpaper: two pairs
to each room on the ground floor, one to each room upstairs. Each pair was
connected with a separate recorder. He followed her up the steep stairs. The top
floor was unfurnished save for an attic bedroom that contained a grey steel frame
with eight tape machines, four up, four down.

“And Jefferson knows all about this?”

“Mr. Jefferson,” said Millie primly, “is run on a basis of trust.” That was the
nearest she came to expressing her disapproval of Smiley, or her devotion to
Christian ethics.

Downstairs again, she showed him the switches that controlled the system. An
extra switch was fitted in each finger panel. Any time Jefferson or one of the
boys, as she put it, wanted to go over to record, he had only to get up and turn
down the left-hand light switch. From then on, the system was voice-activated;
that is to say, the tape deck did not turn unless somebody was speaking.

“And where are you while all this goes on, Millie?”

She remained downstairs, she said, as if that were a woman’s place.

Smiley was pulling open cupboards, lockers, walking from room to room.
Then back to the scullery again, with its view to the canal. Taking out a pocket
torch, he signalled one flash into the darkness of the garden.

“What are the safety procedures?” Smiley asked as he thoughtfully fingered
the end light switch by the drawing-room door.

Her reply came in a liturgical monotone. “Two full milk bottles on the
doorstep, you may come in and all’s well. No milk bottles and you’re not to
enter.”

From the direction of the sunroom came a faint tapping. Returning to the
scullery, Smiley opened the glazed door and after a hastily murmured
conversation reappeared with Guillam.

“You know Peter, don’t you, Millie?”

Millie might, she might not; her little hard eyes had fixed on him with scorn.
He was studying the switch panel, feeling in his pocket as he did so.

“What’s he doing? He’s not to do that. Stop him.”

If she was worried, said Smiley, she should ring Facon on the basement
phone. Millie McCraig didn’t stir, but two red bruises had appeared on her

leathery cheeks and she was snapping her fingers in anger. With a small
screwdriver Guillam had cautiously removed the screws from either side of the
plastic panel, and was peering at the wiring behind. Now, very carefully, he
turned the end switch upside down, twisting it on its wires, then screwed the
plate back in position, leaving the remaining switches undisturbed.

“We’ll just try it,” said Guillam, and while Smiley went upstairs to check the
tape deck, Guillam sang “Old Man River,” in a low Paul Robeson growl.

“Thank you,” said Smiley with a shudder, coming down again. “That’s more
than enough.”

Millie had gone to the basement to ring Lacon. Quietly, Smiley set the stage.
He put the telephone beside an armchair in the drawing-room, then cleared his
line of retreat to the scullery. He fetched two full bottles of milk from the icebox
and placed them on the doorstep to signify, in the eclectic language of Millie
McGraig, that you may come in and all’s well. He removed his shoes and took
them to the scullery, and having put out all the lights, took up his post in the
armchair just as Mendel made his connecting call.

On the canal towpath, meanwhile, Guillam had resumed his vigil of the house.
The footpath is closed to the public one hour before dark: after that it can be
anything from a trysting place for lovers to a haven for down-and-outs; both, for
different reasons, are attracted by the darkness of the bridges. That cold night
Guillam saw neither. Occasionally an empty train raced past, leaving a still
greater emptiness behind. His nerves were so taut, his expectations so varied,
that for a moment he saw the whole architecture of that night in apocalyptic
terms: the signals on the railway bridge turned to gallows; the Victorian
warehouses to gigantic prisons, their windows barred and arched against the
misty sky. Gloser at hand, the ripple of rats and the stink of still water. Then the
drawing-room lights went out; the house stood in darkness except for the chinks
of yellow to either side of Millie’s basement window. From the scullery a pin of
light winked at him down the unkempt garden. Taking a pen torch from his
pocket, he slipped out the silver hood, sighted it with shaking fingers at the point
from which the light had come, and signalled back. From now on, they could
only wait.

Tarr tossed the incoming telegram back to Ben, together with the one-time pad
from the safe.

“Gome on,” he said, “earn your pay. Unbutton it.”

“It’s personal for you,” Ben objected. “Look. 'Personal from Alleline
decypher yourself.’ I’m not allowed to touch it. It’s the tops.”

“Do as he asks, Ben,” said Mackelvore, watching Tarr.

For ten minutes, no word passed between the three men. Tarr was standing
across the room from them, very nervous from the waiting. He had jammed the
gun in his waistband. His jacket lay over a chair. The sweat had stuck his shirt to
his back all the way down. Ben was using a ruler to read off the number groups,
then carefully writing his findings on the block of graph paper before him. To
concentrate, he put his tongue against his teeth, and now he made a small click
as he withdrew it. Putting aside his pencil, he offered Tarr the tearsheet.

“Read it aloud,” Tarr said.

Ben’s voice was kindly, and a little fervent. “ 'Personal for Tarr from Alleline
decypher yourself. I positively require clarification and/or trade samples before
meeting your request. Quote information vital to safeguarding of the service
unquote does not qualify. Let me remind you of your bad position here following
your disgraceful disappearance stop urge you confide Mackelvore immediately
repeat immediately stop Chief.’ ”

Ben had not quite finished before Tarr began laughing in a strange, excited
way.

“That’s the way, Percy boy!” he cried. “Yes repeat no! Know why he’s
stalling, Ben, darling? He’s sizing up to shoot me in the bloody back! That’s how
he got my Russki girl. He’s playing the same tune, the bastard.” He was ruffling
Ben’s hair, shouting at him, laughing. “I warn you, Ben: there’s some damn
lousy people in this outfit, so don’t you trust the one of them. I’m telling you, or
you’ll never grow up strong!”

Alone in the darkness of the drawing-room, Smiley also waited, sitting in the
housekeeper’s uncomfortable chair, his head propped awkwardly against the
earpiece of the telephone. Occasionally he would mutter something and Mendel
would mutter back; most of the time they shared the silence. His mood was
subdued, even a little glum. Like an actor, he had a sense of approaching anti¬
climax before the curtain went up, a sense of great things dwindling to a small,
mean end; as death itself seemed small and mean to him after the struggles of his
life. He had no sense of conquest that he knew of. His thoughts, as often when
he was afraid, concerned people. He had no theories or judgements in particular.
He simply wondered how everyone would be affected; and he felt responsible.
He thought of Jim and Sam and Max and Connie and Jerry Westerby, and
personal loyalties all broken; in a separate category he thought of Ann and the
hopeless dislocation of their talk on the Cornish cliffs; he wondered whether
there was any love between human beings that did not rest upon some sort of
self-delusion; he wished he could just get up and walk out before it happened,
but he couldn’t. He worried, in a quite paternal way, about Guillam, and

wondered how he would take the late strains of growing up. He thought again of
the day he buried Control. He thought about treason and wondered whether there
was mindless treason in the same way, supposedly, as there was mindless
violence. It worried him that he felt so bankrupt; that whatever intellectual or
philosophical precepts he clung to broke down entirely now that he was faced
with the human situation.

“Anything?” he asked Mendel, into the telephone.

“A couple of drunks,” said Mendel, “singing 'See the jungle when it’s wet
with rain.’ ”

“Never heard of it.”

Changing the telephone to his left side, he drew the gun from the wallet
pocket of his jacket, where it had already ruined the excellent silk lining. He
discovered the safety catch, and for a moment played with the idea that he didn’t
know which way was on and which way off. He snapped out the magazine and
put it back, and remembered doing this hundreds of times on the trot, in the night
range at Sarratt before the war; he remembered how you always shot with two
hands, sir, one to hold the gun and one the magazine, sir; and how there was a
piece of Circus folklore which demanded that he should lay his index finger
along the barrel and pull the trigger with his second. But when he tried it the
sensation was ridiculous and he forgot about it.

“Just taking a walk,” he murmured, and Mendel said “Righty-ho.”

The gun still in his hand, he returned to the scullery, listening for a creak in
the floorboards that might give him away, but the floor must have been concrete
under the tatty carpet; he could have jumped and caused not even a vibration.
With his torch he signalled two short flashes, a long delay, then two more. At
once Guillam replied with three short.

“Back again.”

“Got you,” said Mendel.

He settled, thinking glumly of Ann: to dream the impossible dream. He put
the gun in his pocket. From the canal side, the moan of a hooter. At night? Boats
moving at night? Must be a car. What if Gerald has a whole emergency
procedure that we know nothing about? A call-box to call-box, a car pick-up?
What if Polyakov has after all a legman, a helper whom Connie never identified?
He’d been through that already. This system was built to be watertight, to
accommodate meetings in all contingencies. When it comes to tradecraft, Karla
is a pedant.

And his fancy that he was being followed? What of that? What of the shadow
he never saw, only felt, till his back seemed to tingle with the intensity of his
watcher’s gaze; he saw nothing, heard nothing, only felt. He was too old not to

heed the warning. The creak of a stair that had not creaked before; the rustle of a
shutter when no wind was blowing; the car with a different number plate but the
same scratch on the offside wing; the face on the Metro that you know you have
seen somewhere before: for years at a time these were signs he had lived by; any
one of them was reason enough to move, change towns, identities. For in that
profession there is no such thing as coincidence.

“One gone,” said Mendel suddenly. “Hullo?”

“Tm here.”

Somebody had just come out of the Circus, said Mendel. Front door, but he
couldn’t be certain of the identification. Mackintosh and hat. Bulky and moving
fast. He must have ordered a cab to the door and stepped straight into it.

“Heading north, your way.”

Smiley looked at his watch. Give him ten minutes, he thought. Give him
twelve; he’ll have to stop and phone Polyakov on the way. Then he thought.
Don’t be silly, he’s done that already from the Circus.

“I’m ringing off,” said Smiley.

“Cheers,” said Mendel.

On the footpath, Guillam read three long flashes. The mole is on his way.

In the scullery Smiley had once more checked his thoroughfare, shoved some
deck-chairs aside, and pinned a string to the mangle to guide him because he saw
badly in the dark. The string led to the open kitchen door, and the kitchen led to
the drawing-room and dining-room both; it had the two doors side by side. The
kitchen was a long room, actually an annexe to the house before the glass
scullery was added. He had thought of using the dining-room but it was too
risky, and besides from the dining-room he couldn’t signal to Guillam. So he
waited in the scullery, feeling absurd in his stockinged feet, polishing his
spectacles because the heat of his face kept misting them. It was much colder in
the scullery. The drawing-room was close and overheated but the scullery had
these outside walls, and this glass and this concrete floor beneath the matting,
which made his feet feel wet. The mole arrives first, he thought; the mole plays
host: that is protocol, part of the pretence that Polyakov is Gerald’s agent.

A London taxi is a flying bomb.

The comparison rose in him slowly, from deep in his unconscious memory.
The clatter as it barges into the crescent, the metric tick-tick as the bass notes die.
The cut-off: where has it stopped, which house—when all of us on the street are
waiting in the dark, crouching under tables or clutching at pieces of string—
which house? Then the slam of the door, the explosive anti-climax: if you can
hear it, it’s not for you.

But Smiley heard it, and it was for him.

He heard the tread of one pair of feet on the gravel, brisk and vigorous. They
stopped. It’s the wrong door, Smiley thought absurdly; go away. He had the gun
in his hand; he had dropped the catch. Still he listened, heard nothing. You’re
suspicious, Gerald, he thought. You’re an old mole, you can sniff there’s
something wrong. Millie, he thought; Millie has taken away the milk bottles, put
up a warning, headed him off. Millie’s spoilt the kill. Then he heard the latch
turn, one turn, two; it’s a Banham lock, he remembered—my God, we must keep
Banham’s in business. Of course: the mole had been patting his pockets, looking
for his key. A nervous man would have it in his hand already, would have been
clutching it, cosseting it in his pocket all the way in the taxi; but not the mole.
The mole might be worried but he was not nervous. At the same moment the
latch turned, the bell chimed—housekeepers’ taste again: high tone, low tone,
high tone. That will mean it’s one of us, Millie had said; one of the boys, her
boys, Gonnie’s boys, Karla’s boys. The front door opened, someone stepped into
the house, he heard the shuffle of the mat, he heard the door close, he heard the
light switches snap and saw a pale line appear under the kitchen door. He put the
gun in his pocket and wiped the palm of his hand on his jacket, then took it out
again and in the same moment he heard a second flying bomb, a second taxi
pulling up, and footsteps fast. Polyakov didn’t just have the key ready, he had his
taxi money ready, too: do Russians tip, he wondered, or is tipping undemocratic?
Again the bell rang, the front door opened and closed, and Smiley heard the
double chink as two milk bottles were put on the hall table in the interest of good
order and sound tradecraft.

Lord save me, thought Smiley in horror as he stared at the old icebox beside
him; it never crossed my mind: suppose he had wanted to put them back in the
fridge?

The strip of light under the kitchen door grew suddenly brighter as the
drawing-room lights were switched on. An extraordinary silence descended over
the house. Holding the string, Smiley edged forward over the icy floor. Then he
heard voices. At first they were indistinct. They must still be at the far end of the
room, he thought. Or perhaps they always begin in a low tone. Now Polyakov
came nearer: he was at the trolley, pouring drinks.

“What is our cover story in case we are disturbed?” he asked in good English.

“Lovely voice,” Smiley remembered; “mellow like yours. I often used to play
the tapes twice, just to listen to him speaking.” Gonnie, you should hear him
now.

From the further end of the room still, a muffled murmur answered each
question. Smiley could make nothing of it. “Where shall we regroup?” “What is

our fallback?” “Have you anything on you that you would prefer me to be
carrying during our talk, bearing in mind I have diplomatic immunity?”

It must be a catechism, Smiley thought; part of Karla’s school routine.

“Is the switch down? Will you please check? Thank you. What will you
drink?”

“Scotch,” said Haydon, “a bloody great big one.”

With a feeling of utter disbelief, Smiley listened to the familiar voice reading
aloud the very telegram that Smiley himself had drafted for Tarr’s use only forty-
eight hours ago.

Then, for a moment, one part of Smiley broke into open revolt against the
other. The wave of angry doubt that had swept over him in Lacon’s garden, and
that ever since had pulled against his progress like a worrying tide, drove him
now on to the rocks of despair, and then to mutiny: I refuse. Nothing is worth the
destruction of another human being. Somewhere the path of pain and betrayal
must end. Until that happened, there was no future; there was only a continued
slide into still more terrifying versions of the present. This man was my friend
and Ann’s lover, Jim’s friend and—for all I know—Jim’s lover, too; it was the
treason, not the man, that belonged to the public domain.

Haydon had betrayed. As a lover, a colleague, a friend; as a patriot; as a
member of that inestimable body that Ann loosely called the Set: in every
capacity, Haydon had overtly pursued one aim and secretly achieved its opposite.
Smiley knew very well that even now he did not grasp the scope of that
appalling duplicity; yet there was a part of him that rose already in Haydon’s
defence. Was not Bill also betrayed? Connie’s lament rang in his ears: “Poor
loves. Trained to Empire, trained to rule the waves ... You’re the last, George,
you and Bill.” He saw with painful clarity an ambitious man born to the big
canvas, brought up to rule, divide and conquer, whose visions and vanities all
were fixed, like Percy’s, upon the world’s game; for whom the reality was a poor
island with scarcely a voice that would carry across the water. Thus Smiley felt
not only disgust, but, despite all that the moment meant to him, a surge of
resentment against the institutions he was supposed to be protecting: “The social
contract cuts both ways, you know,” said Lacon. The Minister’s lolling
mendacity, Lacon’s tight-lipped moral complacency, the bludgeoning greed of
Percy Alleline: such men invalidated any contract—why should anyone be loyal
to them?

He knew, of course. He had always known it was Bill. Just as Control had
known, and Lacon in Mendel’s house. Just as Connie and Jim had known, and
Alleline and Esterhase; all of them had tacitly shared that unexpressed half¬
knowledge which was like an illness they hoped would go away if it was never

owned to, never diagnosed.

And Ann? Did Ann know? Was that the shadow that fell over them that day
on the Cornish cliffs?

For a space, that was how Smiley stood: a fat, barefooted spy, as Ann would
say, deceived in love and impotent in hate, clutching a gun in one hand, a bit of
string in the other, as he waited in the darkness. Then, gun still in hand, he
tiptoed backward as far as the window, from which he signalled five short
flashes in quick succession. Having waited long enough to read the
acknowledgement, he returned to his listening post.

Guillam raced down the canal towpath, the torch jolting wildly in his hand, till
he reached a low arched bridge and a steel stairway that led upward in zigzags to
Gloucester Avenue. The gate was closed and he had to climb it, ripping one
sleeve to the elbow. Lacon was standing at the corner of Princess Road, wearing
an old country coat and carrying a briefcase.

“He’s there. He’s arrived,” Guillam whispered. “He’s got Gerald.” “I won’t
have bloodshed,” Lacon warned. “I want absolute calm.”

Guillam didn’t bother to reply. Thirty yards down the road Mendel was
waiting in a tame cab. They drove for two minutes, not so much, and stopped the
cab short of the crescent. Guillam was holding Esterhase’s door key. Reaching
number 5, Mendel and Guillam stepped over the gate, rather than risk the noise
of it, and kept to the grass verge. As they went, Guillam glanced back and
thought for a moment he saw a figure watching them—man or woman, he
couldn’t tell—from the shadow of a doorway across the road; but when he drew
Mendel’s attention to the spot there was nothing there, and Mendel ordered him
quite roughly to calm down. The porch light was out. Guillam went ahead;
Mendel waited under an apple tree. Guillam inserted the key, felt the lock ease as
he turned it. Damn fool, he thought triumphantly, why didn’t you drop the latch?
He pushed open the door an inch and hesitated. He was breathing slowly, filling
his lungs for action. Mendel moved forward another bound. In the street two
young boys went by, laughing loudly because they were nervous of the night.
Once more Guillam looked back but the crescent was clear. He stepped into the
hall. He was wearing suede shoes and they squeaked on the parquet; there was
no carpet. At the drawing-room door he listened long enough for the fury to
break in him at last.

His butchered agents in Morocco, his exile to Brixton, the daily frustration of
his efforts as daily he grew older and youth slipped through his fingers; the
drabness that was closing round him; the truncation of his power to love, enjoy,
and laugh; the constant erosion of the standards he wished to live by; the checks

and stops he had imposed on himself in the name of tacit dedication—he could
fling them all in Haydon’s sneering face. Haydon, once his confessor; Haydon,
always good for a laugh, a chat, and a cup of burnt coffee; Haydon, a model on
which he built his life.

And more. Now that he saw, he knew. Haydon was more than his model, he
was his inspiration, the torch-bearer of a certain kind of antiquated romanticism,
a notion of English calling which—for the very reason that it was vague and
understated and elusive—had made sense of Guillam’s life till now. In that
moment, Guillam felt not merely betrayed but orphaned. His suspicions, his
resentments for so long turned outward on the real world—on his women, his
attempted loves—now swung upon the Gircus and the failed magic that had
formed his faith. With all his force he shoved open the door and sprang inside,
gun in hand. Haydon and a heavy man with black hair were seated either side of
a small table. Polyakov—Guillam recognised him from the photographs—was
smoking a very English pipe. He wore a grey cardigan with a zip down the front,
like the top half of a track suit. He had not even taken the pipe from his mouth
before Guillam had Haydon by the collar. With a single heave he lifted him
straight out of his chair. He had thrown away his gun and was hurling Haydon
from side to side, shaking him, and shouting. Then suddenly there seemed no
point. After all, it was only Bill and they had done a lot together. Guillam had
drawn back long before Mendel took his arm, and he heard Smiley, politely as
ever, inviting “Bill and Golonel Viktorov,” as he called them, to raise their hands
and place them on their heads till Percy Alleline arrived.

“There was no one out there, was there, that you noticed?” Smiley asked of
Guillam, while they waited.

“Quiet as the grave,” said Mendel, answering for both of them.
