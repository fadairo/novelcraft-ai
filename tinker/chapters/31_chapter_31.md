Inside the motel room, the state of restlessness was constant. Even when the
traffic outside went through one of its rare lulls, the windows continued
vibrating. In the bathroom the tooth glasses also vibrated, while from either wall
and above them they could hear music, thumps, and bits of conversation or
laughter. When a car arrived in the forecourt, the slam of the door seemed to
happen inside the room, and the footsteps too. Of the furnishings, everything
matched. The yellow chairs matched the yellow pictures and the yellow carpet.
The candlewick bedspreads matched the orange paintwork on the doors, and by
coincidence the label on the vodka bottle. Smiley had arranged things properly.
He had spaced the chairs and put the vodka on the low table, and now as Jim sat
glaring at him he extracted a plate of smoked salmon from the tiny refrigerator,
and brown bread already buttered. His mood in contrast to Jim’s was noticeably
bright, his movements swift and purposeful.

“I thought we should at least be comfortable,” he said, with a short smile,
setting things busily on the table. “When do you have to be at school again? Is
there a particular time?” Receiving no answer, he sat down. “How do you like
teaching? I seem to remember you had a spell of it after the war—is that right?
Before they hauled you back? Was that also a prep school? I don’t think I knew.”

“Look at the file,” Jim barked. “Don’t you come here playing cat-and-mouse
with me, George Smiley. If you want to know things, read my file.”

Reaching across the table, Smiley poured two drinks and handed one to Jim.

“Your personal file at the Circus?”

“Get it from housekeepers. Get it from Control.”

“I suppose I should,” said Smiley doubtfully. “The trouble is Control’s dead
and I was thrown out long before you came back. Didn’t anyone bother to tell
you that when they got you home?”

A softening came over Jim’s face at this, and he made in slow motion one of
those gestures which so amused the boys at Thursgood’s. “Dear God,” he
muttered, “so Control’s gone,” and passed his left hand over the fangs of his
moustache, then upward to his moth-eaten hair. “Poor old devil,” he muttered.
“What did he die of, George? Heart? Heart kill him?”

“They didn’t even tell you this at the debriefing?” Smiley asked.

At the mention of a debriefing, Jim stiffened and his glare returned.

“Yes,” said Smiley. “It was his heart.”

“Who got the job?”

Smiley laughed. “My goodness, Jim, what did you all talk about at Sarratt, if
they didn’t even tell you that?”

“God damn it, who got the job? Wasn’t you, was it—threw you out! Who got
the job, George?”

“Alleline got it,” said Smiley, watching Jim very carefully, noting how the
right forearm rested motionless across the knees. “Who did you want to get it?
Have a candidate, did you, Jim?” And after a long pause: “And they didn’t tell
you what happened to the Aggravate network, by any chance? To Pribyl, to his
wife, and brother-in-law? Or the Plato network? Landkron, Eva Krieglova,
Hanka Bilova? You recruited some of those, didn’t you, in the old days before
Roy Bland? Old Landkron even worked for you in the war.”

There was something terrible just then about the way Jim would not move
forward and could not move back. His red face was twisted with the strain of
indecision and the sweat had gathered in studs over his shaggy ginger eyebrows.

“God damn you, George, what the devil do you want? I’ve drawn a line.
That’s what they told me to do. Draw a line, make a new life, forget the whole
thing.”

“Which they is this, Jim? Roy? Bill, Percy?” He waited. “Did they tell you
what happened to Max, whoever they were? Max is all right, by the way.”
Rising, he briskly refreshed Jim’s drink, then sat again.

“All right, come on, so what’s happened to the networks?”

“They’re blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin. I don’t
believe it. But I have to know what happened.” He went on, “I know Gontrol
made you promise by all that’s holy, but that’s finished. I know you’ve been
questioned to death and I know you’ve pushed some things so far down you can
hardly find them any more or tell the difference between truth and cover. I know
you’ve tried to draw a line under it and say it didn’t happen. I’ve tried that, too.
Well, after tonight you can draw your line. I’ve brought a letter from Lacon and
if you want to ring him he’s standing by. I don’t want to silence you. I’d rather
you talked. Why didn’t you come and see me at home when you got back? You
could have done. You tried to see me before you left, so why not when you got
back? Wasn’t just the rules that kept you away.”

“Didn’t anyone get out?” Jim said.

“No. They seem to have been shot.”

They had telephoned Lacon and now Smiley sat alone sipping his drink. Prom
the bathroom he could hear the sound of running taps and grunts as Jim sluiced
water in his face.

“Lor God’s sake, let’s get somewhere we can breathe,” Jim whispered when

he came back, as if it were a condition of his talking. Smiley picked up the bottle
and walked beside him as they crossed the tarmac to the car.

They drove for twenty minutes, Jim at the wheel. When they parked, they
were on the plateau, this morning’s hilltop free of fog, and a long view down the
valley. Scattered lights reached into the distance. Jim sat as still as iron, right
shoulder high and hands hung down, gazing through the misted windscreen at
the shadow of the hills. The sky was light and Jim’s face was cut sharp against it.
Smiley kept his first questions short. The anger had left Jim’s voice and little by
little he spoke with greater ease. Once, discussing Control’s tradecraft, he even
laughed, but Smiley never relaxed; he was as cautious as if he were leading a
child across the street. When Jim ran on, or bridled, or showed a flash of temper,
Smiley gently drew him back until they were level again, moving at the same
pace and in the same direction. When Jim hesitated, Smiley coaxed him forward
over the obstacle. At first, by a mixture of instinct and deduction, Smiley
actually fed Jim his own story.

For Jim’s first briefing by Control, Smiley suggested, they had made a
rendezvous outside the Circus? They had. Where? At a service flat in St.

James’s, a place proposed by Control. Was anyone else present? No one. And to
get in touch with Jim in the first place. Control had used MacFadean, his
personal janitor? Yes, old Mac came over on the Brixton shuttle with a note
asking Jim for a meeting that night. Jim was to tell Mac yes or no and give him
back the note. He was on no account to use the telephone, even the internal line,
to discuss the arrangement. Jim had told Mac yes and arrived at seven.

“First, I suppose. Control cautioned you?”

“Told me not to trust anyone.”

“Did he name particular people?”

“Later,” said Jim. “Not at first. At first, he just said trust nobody. Specially
nobody in the mainstream. George?”

“Yes.”

“They were shot all right, were they? Landkron, Krieglova, Bilova, the
Pribyls? Straight shooting?”

“The secret police rolled up both networks the same night. After that no one
knows, but next of kin were told they were dead. That usually means they are.”

To their left, a line of pine trees like a motionless army climbed out of the
valley.

“And then, I suppose. Control asked you what Czech identities you had
running for you,” Smiley resumed. “Is that right?”

He had to repeat the question.

“I told him Hajek,” said Jim finally. “Vladimir Hajek, Czech journalist based

on Paris. Control asked me how much longer the papers were good for. 'You
never know/ I said. 'Sometimes they’re blown after one trip.’ ” His voice went
suddenly louder, as if he had lost his hold on it. “Deaf as an adder, Control was,
when he wanted to be.”

“So then he told you what he wanted you to do,” Smiley suggested.

“First, we discussed deniability. He said if I was caught, I should keep Control
out of it. A scalp-hunter ploy, bit of private enterprise. Even at the time I thought.
Who the hell will ever believe that? Every word he spoke was letting blood,”
said Jim. “All through the briefing, I could feel his resistance to telling me
anything. He didn’t want me to know but he wanted me well briefed. 'I’ve had
an offer of service,’ Control says. 'Highly placed official, cover name Testify.’
'Czech official?’ I ask. 'On the military side,’ he says. 'You’re a military minded
man, Jim, you two should hit it off pretty well.’ That’s how it went, the whole
damn way. I thought. If you don’t want to tell me, don’t, but stop dithering.”

After more circling, said Jim, Control announced that Testify was a Czech
general of artillery. His name was Stevcek; he was known as a pro-Soviet hawk
in the Prague defence hierarchy, whatever that was worth; he had worked in
Moscow on liaison and was one of the very few Czechs the Russians trusted.
Stevcek had conveyed to Control, through an intermediary whom Control had
personally interviewed in Austria, his desire to talk to a ranking officer of the
Circus on matters of mutual interest. The emissary must be a Czech speaker,
somebody able to take decisions. On Friday, October 20th, Stevcek would be
inspecting the weapon research station at Tisnov, near Brno, about a hundred
miles north of the Austrian border. From there he would be visiting a hunting-
lodge for the weekend, alone. It was a place high up in the forests not far from
Racice. He would be willing to receive an emissary there on the evening of
Saturday, the twenty-first. He would also supply an escort to and from Brno.

Smiley asked, “Did Control have any suggestions about Stevcek’s motive?”

“A girlfriend,” Jim said. “Student he was going with, having a last spring.
Control said; twenty years’ age difference between them. She was shot during
the uprising of summer ’68. Till then, Stevcek had managed to bury his anti-
Russian feelings in favour of his career. The girl’s death put an end to all that: he
was out for their blood. For four years he’d lain low acting friendly and salting
away information that would really hurt them. Soon as we gave him assurances
and fixed the trade routes, he was ready to sell.”

“Had Control checked any of this?”

“What he could. Stevcek was well enough documented. Hungry desk general
with a long list of staff appointments. Technocrat. When he wasn’t on courses,
he was sharpening his teeth abroad: Warsaw, Moscow, Peking for a year, spell of

military attache in Africa, Moscow again. Young for his rank.”

“Did Control tell you what you were to expect in the way of information?”

“Defence material. Rocketry. Ballistics.”

“Anything else?” said Smiley, passing the bottle.

“Bit of politics.”

“Anything else?”

Not for the first time, Smiley had the distinct sense of stumbling not on Jim’s
ignorance but on the relic of a willed determination not to remember. In the dark,
Jim Prideaux’s breathing became suddenly deep and greedy. He had lifted his
hands to the top of the wheel and was resting his chin on them, peering blankly
at the frosted windscreen.

“How long were they in the bag before being shot?” Jim demanded to know.

“I’m afraid, a lot longer than you were,” Smiley confessed.

“Holy God,” said Jim. With a handkerchief taken from his sleeve, he wiped
away the perspiration and whatever else was glistening on his face.

“The intelligence Control was hoping to get out of Stevcek,” Smiley
prompted, ever so softly.

“That’s what they asked me at the interrogation.”

“At Sarratt?”

Jim shook his head. “Over there.” He nodded his untidy head towards the
hills. “They knew it was Control’s operation from the start. There was nothing I
could say to persuade them it was mine. They laughed.”

Once again Smiley waited patiently till Jim was ready to go on.

“Stevcek,” said Jim. “Control had this bee in his bonnet: Stevcek would
provide the answer, Stevcek would provide the key. 'What key?’ I asked. 'What
key?’ Had his bag, that old brown music case. Pulled out charts, annoted all in
his own handwriting. Charts in coloured inks, crayons. 'Your visual aid,’ he says.
'This is the fellow you’ll be meeting.’ Stevcek’s career plotted year by year: took
me right through it. Military academies, medals, wives. 'He’s fond of horses,’ he
says. 'You used to ride yourself, Jim. Something else in common—remember it.’
I thought. That’ll be fun, sitting in Czecho with the dogs after me, talking about
breaking thoroughbred mares.” He laughed a little strangely, so Smiley laughed,
too.

“The appointments in red were for Stevcek’s Soviet liaison work. Green were
his intelligence work. Stevcek had had a finger in everything. Fourth man in
Czech army intelligence, chief boffin on weaponry, secretary to the national
internal security committee, military counsellor of some sort to the Praesidium,
Anglo-American desk in the Czech military intelligence set-up. Then Control
comes to this patch in the mid-sixties, Stevcek’s second spell in Moscow, and it’s

marked green and red fifty-fifty. Ostensibly, Stevcek was attached to the Warsaw
Pact Liaison staff as a colonel general, says Control, but that was just cover.
'He’d nothing to do with the Warsaw Pact Liaison staff. His real job was in
Moscow Centre’s England section. He operated under the workname of Minin,’
he says. 'His job was dovetailing Czech efforts with Centre’s. This is the
treasure,’ Control says. 'What Stevcek really wants to sell us is the name of
Moscow Centre’s mole inside the Circus.’ ”

It might be only one word, Smiley thought, remembering Max, and felt again
that sudden wave of apprehension. In the end, he knew, that was all it would be:
a name for the mole Gerald, a scream in the dark.

“ 'There’s a rotten apple, Jim,’ Control said, 'and he’s infecting all the others.’
” Jim was going straight on. His voice had stiffened, his manner also. “Kept
talking about elimination, how he’d backtracked and researched and was nearly
there. There were five possibilities, he said. Don’t ask me how he dug them up.
'It’s one of the top five,’ he says. 'Five fingers to a hand.’ He gave me a drink
and we sat there like a pair of schoolboys making up a code, me and Control. We
used Tinker, Tailor. We sat there in the flat putting it together, drinking that
cheap Cyprus sherry he always gave. If 1 couldn’t get out, if there was any
fumble after I’d met Stevcek, if 1 had to go underground, 1 must get the one word
to him, even if 1 had to go to Prague and chalk it on the Embassy door or ring the
Prague resident and yell it at him down the phone. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor.
Alleline was Tinker, Haydon was Tailor, Bland was Soldier, and Toby Esterhase
was Poorman. We dropped Sailor because it rhymed with Tailor. You were
Beggarman,” Jim said.

“Was 1, now? And how did you take to it, Jim, to Control’s theory? How did
the idea strike you, over-all?”

“Damn silly. Poppycock.”

“Why?”

“Just damn silly,” he repeated in a tone of military stubbornness. “Think of
any one of you—mole— mad! ”

“But did you believe it?”

“No! Lord alive, man, why do you—”

“Why not? Rationally we always accepted that sooner or later it would
happen. We always warned one another: be on your guard. We’ve turned up
enough members of other outfits: Russians, Poles, Czechs, French. Even the odd
American. What’s so special about the British, all of a sudden?”

Sensing Jim’s antagonism, Smiley opened his door and let the cold air pour in.

“How about a stroll?” he said. “No point in being cooped up when we can
walk around.”

With movement, as Smiley had anticipated, Jim found a new fluency of
speech.

They were on the western rim of the plateau, with only a few trees standing
and several lying felled. A frosted bench was offered, but they ignored it. There
was no wind, the stars were very clear, and as Jim took up his story they went on
walking side by side, Jim adjusting always to Smiley’s pace, now away from the
car, now back again. Occasionally they drew up, shoulder to shoulder, facing
down the valley.

First Jim described his recruitment of Max and the manoeuvres he went
through in order to disguise his mission from the rest of the Circus. He let it leak
that he had a tentative lead to a high-stepping Soviet cypher clerk in Stockholm,
and booked himself to Copenhagen in his old workname Ellis. Instead, he flew
to Paris, switched to his Hajek papers, and landed by scheduled flight at Prague
airport at ten on Saturday morning. He went through the barriers like a song,
confirmed the time of his train at the terminus, then took a walk because he had
a couple of hours to kill and thought he might watch his back a little before he
left for Brno. That autumn there had been freak bad weather. There was snow on
the ground and more falling.

In Czecho, said Jim, surveillance was not usually a problem. The security
services knew next to nothing about street-watching, probably because no
administration in living memory had ever had to feel shy about it. The tendency,
said Jim, was still to throw cars and pavement artists around like A1 Capone, and
that was what Jim was looking for: black Skodas and trios of squat men in
trilbies. In the cold, spotting these things is marginally harder because the traffic
is slow, the people walk faster, and everyone is muffled to the nose. All the
same, till he reached Masaryk Station—or Central, as they’re pleased to call it
these days—he had no worries. But at Masaryk, said Jim, he got a whisper, more
instinct than fact, about two women who’d bought tickets ahead of him.

Here, with the dispassionate ease of a professional, Jim went back over the
ground. In a covered shopping arcade beside Wenceslaus Square he had been
overtaken by three women, of whom the one in the middle was pushing a pram.
The woman nearest the curb carried a red plastic handbag and the woman on the
inside was walking a dog on a lead. Ten minutes later two other women came
towards him, arm in arm, both in a hurry, and it crossed his mind that if Toby
Esterhase had had the running of the job, an arrangement like this would be his
handwriting; quick profile changes from the pram, backup cars standing off with
short-wave radio or bleep, with a second team lying back in case the forward
party overran. At Masaryk, looking at the two women ahead of him in the ticket
queue, Jim was faced with the knowledge that it was happening now. There is

one garment that a watcher has neither time nor inclination to change, least of all
in sub-Arctic weather, and that is his shoes. Of the two pairs offered for his
inspection in the ticket queue, Jim recognised one: furlined plastic, black, with
zips on the outside and soles of a thick brown composition that sang slightly in
the snow. He had seen them once already that morning, in the Sterba passage,
worn with different top clothes by the woman who had pushed past him with the
pram. From then on, Jim didn’t suspect. He knew, just as Smiley would have
known.

At the station bookstall, Jim bought himself a Rude Pravo and boarded the
Brno train. If they had wanted to arrest him, they would have done so by now.
They must be after the branch lines: they were following Jim in order to house
his contacts. There was no point in looking for reasons, but Jim guessed that the
Hajek identity was blown and they’d primed the trap the moment he booked
himself on the plane. As long as they didn’t know he had flushed them, he still
had the edge, said Jim; and for a moment Smiley was back in occupied
Germany, in his own time as a field agent, living with terror in his mouth, naked
to every stranger’s glance.

He was supposed to catch the thirteen-eight arriving Brno sixteen-twenty-
seven. It was cancelled, so he took some wonderful stopping train, a special for
the football match, which called at every other lamp-post, and each time Jim
reckoned he could pick out the hoods. The quality was variable. At Chocen, a
one-horse place if ever he saw one, he got out and bought himself a sausage, and
there were no fewer than five, all men, spread down the tiny platform with their
hands in their pockets, pretending to chat to one another and making damn fools
of themselves.

“If there’s one thing that distinguishes a good watcher from a bad one,” said
Jim, “it’s the gentle art of doing damn all convincingly.”

At Svitavy two men and a woman entered his carriage and talked about the
big match. After a while Jim joined the conversation; he had been reading up the
form in his newspaper. It was a club replay, and everyone was going crazy about
it. By Brno, nothing more had happened, so he got out and sauntered through
shops and crowded areas where they had to stay close for fear of losing him.

He wanted to lull them, demonstrate to them that he suspected nothing. He
knew now that he was the target of what Toby would call a grand-slam
operation. On foot they were working teams of seven. The cars changed so often
he couldn’t count them. The over-all direction came from a scruffy green van
driven by a thug. The van had a loop aerial and a chalk star scrawled high on the
back where no child could reach. The cars, where he picked them out, were
declared to one another by a woman’s handbag on the gloveboard and a

passenger sun visor turned down. He guessed there were other signs but those
two were good enough for him. He knew from what Toby had told him that jobs
like this could cost a hundred people and were unwieldy if the quarry bolted.
Toby hated them for that reason.

There is one store in Brno main square that sells everything, said Jim.
Shopping in Czecho is usually a bore because there are so few retail outlets for
each state industry, but this place was new and quite impressive. He bought
children’s toys, a scarf, some cigarettes, and tried on shoes. He guessed his
watchers were still waiting for his clandestine contact. He stole a fur hat and a
white plastic raincoat and a carrier bag to put them in. He loitered at the men’s
department long enough to confirm that two women who formed the forward
pair were still behind him but reluctant to come too close. He guessed they had
signalled for men to take over, and were waiting. In the men’s lavatory he moved
very fast. He pulled the white raincoat over his overcoat, stuffed the carrier bag
into the pocket, and put on the fur hat. He abandoned his remaining parcels, then
ran like a madman down the emergency staircase, smashed open a fire door,
pelted down an alley, strolled up another, which was one-way, stuffed the white
raincoat into the carrier bag, sauntered into another store, which was just closing,
and there bought a black raincoat to replace the white one. Using the departing
shoppers for cover, he squeezed into a crowded tram, stayed aboard till the last
stop but one, walked for an hour, and made the fallback with Max to the minute.

Here he described his dialogue with Max and said they nearly had a standing
fight.

Smiley asked, “It never crossed your mind to drop the job?”

“No. It did not,” Jim snapped, his voice rising in a threat.

“Although, right from the start, you thought the idea was poppycock?” There
was nothing but deference in Smiley’s tone. No edge, no wish to score: only a
wish to have the truth, clear under the night sky. “You just kept marching. You’d
seen what was on your back, you thought the mission absurd, but you still went
on, deeper and deeper into the jungle.”

“I did.”

“Had you perhaps changed your mind about the mission? Did curiosity draw
you, after all—was that it? You wanted passionately to know who the mole was,
for instance? I’m only speculating, Jim.”

“What’s the difference? What the hell does my motive matter in a damn mess
like this?”

The half-moon was free of cloud and seemed very close. Jim sat on the bench.
It was bedded in loose gravel, and while he spoke he occasionally picked up a
pebble and flicked it backhand into the bracken. Smiley sat beside him, looking

nowhere but at Jim. Once, to keep him company, he took a pull of vodka and
thought of Tarr and Irina drinking on their hilltop in Hong Kong. It must be a
habit of the trade, he decided: we talk better when there’s a view.

Through the window of the parked Fiat, said Jim, the word code passed off
without a hitch. The driver was one of those stiff, muscle-bound Czech Magyars
with an Edwardian moustache and a mouthful of garlic. Jim didn’t like him but
he hadn’t expected to. The two back doors were locked and there was a row
about where he should sit. The Magyar said it was insecure for Jim to be in the
back. It was also undemocratic. Jim told him to go to hell. He asked Jim whether
he had a gun, and Jim said no, which was not true, but if the Magyar didn’t
believe him he didn’t dare say so. He asked whether Jim had brought
instructions for the General. Jim said he had brought nothing. He had come to
listen.

Jim felt a bit nervy, he said. They drove and the Magyar said his piece. When
they reached the lodge, there would be no lights and no sign of life. The General
would be inside. If there was any sign of life—a bicycle, a car, a light, a dog—if
there was any sign that the hut was occupied, then the Magyar would go in first
and Jim would wait in the car. Otherwise Jim should go in alone and the Slav
would do the waiting. Was that clear?

Why didn’t they just go in together? Jim asked. Because the General didn’t
want them to, said the Slav.

They drove for half an hour by Jim’s watch, heading north east at an average
of thirty kilometres an hour. The track was winding and steep and tree-lined.
There was no moon and he could see very little except occasionally against the
skyline more forest, more hilltops. The snow had come from the north, he
noticed; it was a point that was useful later. The track was clear but rutted by
heavy lorries. They drove without lights. The Magyar had begun telling a dirty
story and Jim guessed it was his way of being nervous. The smell of garlic was
awful. He seemed to chew it all the time. Without warning, he cut the engine.
They were running downhill, but more slowly. They had not quite stopped when
the Magyar reached for the handbrake and Jim smashed his head against the
window-post and took his gun. They were at the opening to a side-path. Thirty
yards down this path lay a low wooden hut. There was no sign of life.

Jim told the Magyar what he would like him to do. He would like him to wear
Jim’s fur hat and Jim’s coat and take the walk for him. He should take it slowly,
keeping his hands linked behind his back, and walking at the centre of the path.
If he failed to do either of those things, Jim would shoot him. When he reached
the hut, he should go inside and explain to the General that Jim was indulging in
an elementary precaution. Then he should walk back slowly, report to Jim that

all was well, and that the General was ready to receive him. Or not, as the case
might be.

The Magyar didn’t seem very happy about this but he didn’t have much
choice. Before he got out, Jim made him turn the car round and face it down the
path. If there was any monkey business, Jim explained, he would put on the
headlights and shoot him along the beam, not once but several times, and not in
the legs. The Magyar began his walk. He had nearly reached the hut when the
whole area was floodlit: the hut, the path, and a large space around. Then a
number of things happened at once. Jim didn’t see everything, because he was
busy turning the car. He saw four men fall out of the trees, and so far as he could
work out, one of them had sandbagged the Magyar. Shooting started but none of
the four paid it any attention; they were standing back while somebody took
photographs. The shooting seemed to be directed at the clear sky behind the
floodlights. It was very theatrical. Flares exploded. Very lights went up, even
tracers, and as Jim raced the Fiat down the track, he had the impression of
leaving a military tattoo at its climax. He was almost clear—he really felt he was
clear—when from the woods to his right someone opened up with a machine-
gun at close quarters. The first burst shot off a back wheel and turned the car
over. He saw the wheel fly over the bonnet as the car took to the ditch on the left.
The ditch might have been ten feet deep but the snow let him down kindly. The
car didn’t burn so he lay behind it and waited, facing across the track hoping to
get a shot at the machine-gunner. The next burst came from behind him and
threw him up against the car. The woods must have been crawling with troops.
He knew that he had been hit twice. Both shots caught him in the right shoulder
and it seemed amazing to him, as he lay there watching the tattoo, that they
hadn’t taken off the arm. A klaxon sounded, maybe two or three. An ambulance
rolled down the track and there was still enough shooting to frighten the game
for years. The ambulance reminded him of those old Hollywood fire engines, it
was so upright. A whole mock battle was taking place, yet the ambulance boys
stood gazing at him without a care in the world. He was losing consciousness as
he heard a second car arrive, and men’s voices, and more photographs were
taken, this time of the right man. Someone gave orders, but he couldn’t tell what
they were because they were given in Russian. His one thought, as they dumped
him on the stretcher and the lights went out, concerned going back to London.

He imagined himself in the St. James’s flat, with the coloured charts and the
sheaf of notes, sitting in the armchair and explaining to Control how in their old
age the two of them had walked into the biggest sucker’s punch in the history of
the trade. His only consolation was that they had sandbagged the Magyar, but
looking back Jim wished very much he’d broken his neck for him: it was a thing

he could have managed very easily, and without compunction.
