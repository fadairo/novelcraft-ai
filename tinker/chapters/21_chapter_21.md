“Our Shadow Foreign Secretary,” Haydon called him. The janitors called him
“Snow White” because of his hair. Toby Esterhase dressed like a male model,
but the moment he dropped his shoulders or closed his tiny fists he was
unmistakably a fighter. Following him down the fourth-floor corridor—noting
the coffee machine again, and Lauder Strickland’s voice explaining that he was
unobtainable—Guillam thought, Christ, we’re back in Berne and on the run.

He’d half a mind to call this out to Toby, but decided the comparison was
unwise.

Whenever he thought of Toby, that was what he thought of: Switzerland eight
years ago, when Toby was just a humdrum watcher with a growing reputation
for informal listening on the side. Guillam was kicking his heels after North
Africa, so the Circus packed them both off to Berne on a one-time operation to
spike a pair of Belgian arms dealers who were using the Swiss to spread their
wares in unpopular directions. They rented a villa next door to the target house,
and the following night Toby opened up a junction box and rearranged things so
that they overheard the Belgians’ conversations on their own phone. Guillam
was boss and legman, and twice a day he dropped the tapes on the Berne
residency, using a parked car as a letter-box. With the same ease, Toby bribed the
local postman to give him a first sight of the Belgians’ mail before he delivered
it, and the cleaning lady to plant a radio mike in the drawing room where they
held most of their discussions. For diversion, they went to the Chikito and Toby
danced with the youngest girls. Now and then he brought one home, but by
morning she was always gone and Toby had the windows open to get rid of the
smell.

They lived this way for three months and Guillam knew him no better at the
end than he had on the first day. He didn’t even know his country of origin. Toby
was a snob, and knew the places to eat and be seen. He washed his own clothes
and at night he wore a net over his snow white hair, and on the day the police hit
the villa and Guillam had to hop over the back wall, he found Toby at the
Bellevue Hotel munching patisseries and watching the the dansant. He listened
to what Guillam had to say, paid his bill, tipped first the bandleader, then Franz,
the head porter, and then led the way along a succession of corridors and
staircases to the underground garage where he had cached the escape car and
passports. There also, punctiliously, he asked for his bill. Guillam thought. If you
ever want to get out of Switzerland in a hurry, you pay your bills first. The

corridors were endless, with mirror walls and Versailles chandeliers, so that
Guillam was following not just one Esterhase but a whole delegation of them.

It was this vision that came back to him now, though the narrow wooden
staircase to Alleline’s rooms was painted mud-green and only a battered
parchment lampshade recalled the chandeliers.

“To see the Chief,” Toby announced portentously to the young janitor who
beckoned them through with an insolent nod. In the anteroom at four grey
typewriters sat the four grey mothers, in pearls and twin-sets. They nodded to
Guillam and ignored Toby. A sign over Alleline’s door said “Engaged.” Beside
it, a six-foot wardrobe safe, new. Guillam wondered how on earth the floor took
the strain. On its top, bottles of South African sherry; glasses, plates. Tuesday, he
remembered: London Station’s informal lunch meeting.

“I’ll have no phone calls, tell them,” Alleline shouted as Toby opened the
door.

“The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies,” said Toby elaborately, holding
back the door for Guillam. “We are having a conference.”

One of the mothers said, “We heard.”

It was a war party.

Alleline sat at the head of the table in the megalomaniac’s throne, reading a
two-page document, and he didn’t stir when Guillam came in. He just growled,
“Down there with you. By Paul. Below the salt,” and went on reading with
heavy concentration.

The chair to Alleline’s right was empty, and Guillam knew it was Haydon’s by
the posture-curve cushion tied to it with string. To Alleline’s left sat Roy Bland,
also reading, but he looked up as Guillam passed, and said “Wotcher, Peter,”
then followed him all the way down the table with his bulging eyes. Next to
Bill’s empty chair sat Mo Delaware, London Station’s token woman, in bobbed
hair and a brown tweed suit. Across from her, Phil Porteous, the head
housekeeper, a rich servile man with a big house in suburbia. When he saw
Guillam, he stopped his reading altogether, ostentatiously closed the folder, laid
his sleek hands over it, and smirked.

“ 'Below the salt’ means next to Paul Skordeno,” said Phil, still smirking.

“Thanks. I can see it.”

Across from Porteous came Bill’s Russians, last seen in the fourth-floor men’s
room, Nick de Silsky and his boyfriend Kaspar. They couldn’t smile, and for all
Guillam knew they couldn’t read, either, because they had no papers in front of
them; they were the only ones who hadn’t. They sat with their four thick hands
on the table as if somebody were holding a gun behind them, and they just

watched him with their four brown eyes.

Downhill from Porteous sat Paul Skordeno, now reputedly Roy Bland’s
fieldman on the satellite networks, though others said he ran between wickets for
Bill. Paul was thin and mean and forty, with a pitted brown face and long arms.
Guillam had once paired with him on a tough-guy course at the Nursery and they
all but killed each other.

Guillam moved the chair away from him and sat down, so Toby sat next along
like the other half of a bodyguard. Guillam thought. What the hell do they expect
me to do—make a mad dash for freedom? Everyone was watching Alleline fill
his pipe when Bill Haydon upstaged him. The door opened and at first no one
came in. Then a slow shuffle and Bill appeared, clutching a cup of coffee in both
hands, the saucer on top. He had a striped folder jammed under his arm and his
glasses were over his nose, for a change, so he must have done his reading
elsewhere. They’ve all been reading it except me, thought Guillam, and I don’t
know what it is. He wondered whether it was the same document that Esterhase
and Roy were reading yesterday, and decided on no evidence at all that it was;
that yesterday it had just come in, that Toby had brought it to Roy, and that he
had disturbed them in their first excitement—if excitement was the word.

Alleline had still not looked up. Down the table Guillam had only his rich
black hair to look at, and a pair of broad tweedy shoulders. Mo Delaware was
pulling at her fringe while she read. Percy had two wives, Guillam remembered,
as Gamilla once more flitted through his teeming mind, and both were
alcoholics, which must mean something. He had met only the London edition.
Percy was forming his supporters’ club and gave a drinks party at his sprawling
panelled flat in Buckingham Palace Mansions. Guillam arrived late and he was
taking off his coat in the lobby when a pale blond woman loomed timidly
towards him holding out her hands. He took her for the maid wanting his coat.

“I’m Joy,” she said, in a theatrical voice, like “I’m Virtue” or “I’m
Gontinence.” It wasn’t his coat she wanted but a kiss. Yielding to it, Guillam
inhaled the joint pleasures of Je Reviens and a high concentration of inexpensive
sherry.

“Well, now, young Peter Guillam”—Alleline speaking—“are you ready for
me finally or have you other calls to make about my house?” He half looked up
and Guillam noticed two tiny triangles of fur on each weathered cheek. “What
are you getting up to out there in the sticks these days”—turning a page—“apart
from chasing the local virgins, if there are any in Brixton, which I severely doubt
—if you’ll pardon my freedom. Mo—and wasting public money on expensive
lunches?”

This banter was Alleline’s one instrument of communication; it could be

friendly or hostile, reproachful or congratulatory, but in the end it was like a
constant tapping on the same spot.

“Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Cy Vanhofer’s got a lead to a
German diplomat. That’s about it.”

“Arabs,” Alleline repeated, pushing aside the folder and dragging a rough pipe
from his pocket. “Any bloody fool can burn an Arab—can’t he. Bill? Buy a
whole damn Arab Cabinet for half a crown, if you’ve a mind to.” From another
pocket Alleline took a tobacco pouch, which he tossed easily onto the table. “I
hear you’ve been hobnobbing with our late-lamented Brother Tarr. How is he
these days?”

A lot of things went through Guillam’s mind as he heard himself answer. That
the surveillance on his flat did not begin till last night—he was sure of it. That
over the weekend he was in the clear unless Fawn, the captive baby-sitter, had
doubled, which would have been hard for him. That Roy Bland bore a close
resemblance to the late Dylan Thomas: Roy had always reminded him of
someone and till this moment he’d never been able to pin down the connection;
and that Mo Delaware had only passed muster as a woman because of her
brownie mannishness. He wondered whether Dylan Thomas had had Roy’s
extraordinary blue eyes. That Toby Esterhase was helping himself to a cigarette
from his gold case, and that Alleline didn’t as a rule allow cigarettes but only
pipes, so Toby must stand pretty well with Alleline just now. That Bill Haydon
was looking strangely young and that Circus rumours about his love-life were
not after all so laughable: they said he went both ways. That Paul Skordeno had
one brown palm flat on the table and the thumb slightly lifted in a way that
hardened the hitting surface on the outside of the hand. He thought also of his
canvas case: had Alwyn put it on the shuttle? Or had he gone off for his lunch
leaving it in Registry, waiting to be inspected by one of the new young janitors
busting for promotion? And Guillam wondered—not for the first time—^just how
long Toby had been hanging around Registry before Guillam noticed him.

He selected a facetious tone: “That’s right. Chief. Tarr and I have tea at
Fortnum’s every afternoon.”

Alleline was sucking at his empty pipe, testing the packing of the tobacco.

“Peter Guillam,” he said deliberately, in his pert brogue. “You may not be
aware of this, but I am of an extremely forgiving nature. I am positively seething
with goodwill, in fact. All I require is the matter of your discussion with Tarr. I
do not ask for his head, nor any other part of his damned anatomy, and I will
restrain my impulse personally to strangle him. Or you.” He struck a match and
lit his pipe, making a monstrous flame. “I would even go so far as to consider
hanging a gold chain about your neck and bringing you into the palace from

hateful Brixton.”

“In that case, I can’t wait for him to turn up,” said Guillam.

“And there’s a free pardon for Tarr till I get my hands on him.”

“I’ll tell him. He’ll be thrilled.”

A great cloud of smoke rolled out over the table.

“I’m very disappointed with you, young Peter. Giving ear to gross slanders of
a divisive and insidious nature. I pay you honest money and you stab me in the
back. I consider that extremely poor reward for keeping you alive. Against the
entreaties of my advisers, I may tell you.”

Alleline had a new mannerism, one that Guillam had noticed often in vain
men of middle age: it involved taking hold of a tuck of flesh under the chin and
massaging it between finger and thumb in the hope of reducing it.

“Tell us some more about Tarr’s circumstances just now,” said Alleline. “Tell
us about his emotional state. He has a daughter, has he not? A wee daughter
name of Danny. Does he talk of her at all?”

“He used to.”

“Regale us with some anecdotes about her.”

“I don’t know any. He was very fond of her, that’s all I know.”

“Obsessively fond?” His voice rose suddenly in anger. “What’s that shrug for?
What the hell are you shrugging at me like that for? I’m talking to you about a
defector from your own damn section; I’m accusing you of playing hookey with
him behind my back, of taking part in damn-fool parlour games when you don’t
know the stakes involved, and all you do is shrug at me down the table. There’s a
law, Peter Guillam, against consorting with enemy agents. Maybe you didn’t
know that. I’ve a good mind to throw the book at you!”

“But I haven’t been seeing him,” said Guillam as anger came also to his
rescue. “It’s not me who’s playing parlour games. It’s you. So get off my back.”

In the same moment he sensed the relaxation round the table, like a tiny
descent into boredom, like a general recognition that Alleline had shot off all his
ammunition and the target was unmarked. Skordeno was fidgeting with a bit of
ivory, some lucky charm he carried round with him. Bland was reading again
and Bill Haydon was drinking his coffee and finding it terrible, for he made a
sour face at Mo Delaware and put down the cup. Toby Esterhase, chin in hand,
had raised his eyebrows and was gazing at the red cellophane that filled the
Victorian grate. Only the Russians continued to watch him unblinkingly, like a
pair of terriers not wanting to believe that the hunt was over.

“So he used to chat to you about Danny, eh? And he told you he loved her,”
said Alleline, back at the document before him. “Who’s Danny’s mother?”

“A Eurasian girl.”

Now Haydon spoke for the first time. “Unmistakably Eurasian, or could she
pass for something nearer home?”

“Tarr seems to think she looks full European. He thinks the kid does, too.”

Alleline read aloud: “Twelve years old, long blond hair, brown eyes, slim. Is
that Danny?”

“I should think it could be. It sounds like her.”

There was a long silence and not even Haydon seemed inclined to break it.

“So if I told you,” Alleline resumed, choosing his words extremely carefully:
“if I told you that Danny and her mother were due to arrive three days ago at
London Airport on the direct flight from Singapore, I may take it you would
share our perplexity.”

“Yes, I would.”

“You would also keep your mouth shut when you got out of here. You’d tell
no one but your twelve best friends?”

From not far away came Phil Porteous’s purr: “The source is extremely secret,
Peter. It may sound to you like ordinary flight information but it isn’t that at all.
It’s ultra, ultra sensitive.”

“Ah, well, in that case I’ll try to keep my mouth ultra shut,” said Guillam to
Porteous, and while Porteous coloured Bill Haydon gave another schoolboy grin.

Alleline came back. “So what would you make of this information? Come on,
Peter—” the banter again—“Come on, you were his boss, his guide, philosopher,
and his friend. Where’s your psychology, for God’s sake? Why is Tarr coming to
England?”

“That’s not what you said at all. You said Tarr’s girl and her daughter Danny
were expected in London three days ago. Perhaps she’s visiting relations.

Perhaps she’s got a new boyfriend. How should I know?”

“Don’t be obtuse, man. Doesn’t it occur to you that where little Danny is, Tarr
himself is unlikely to be far behind? If he’s not here already, which I’m inclined
to believe he is, that being the manner of men to come first and bring their
impedimenta later. Pardon me. Mo Delaware, a lapse.”

For the second time, Guillam allowed himself a little temperament. “Till now
it had not occurred to me, no. Till now Tarr was a defector. Housekeepers’ ruling
as of seven months ago. Right or wrong, Phil? Tarr was sitting in Moscow and
everything he knew should be regarded as blown. Right, Phil? That was also
held to be a good enough reason for turning the lights out in Brixton and giving
one chunk of our workload to London Station and another to Toby’s
lamplighters. What’s Tarr supposed to be doing now, redefecting to us?”

“Redefecting would be a damned charitable way of putting it. I’ll tell you that
for nothing,” Alleline retorted, back at the paper before him. “Listen to me.

Listen exactly, and remember. Because I’ve no doubt that, like the rest of my
staff, you’ve a memory like a sieve—all you prima donnas are the same. Danny
and her mother are travelling on fake British passports in the name of Poole, like
the harbour. The passports are Russian fakes. A third went to Tarr himself, the
well-known Mr. Poole. Tarr is already in England but we don’t know where. He
left ahead of Danny and her mother and came here by a different route; our
investigations suggest a black one. He instructed his wife or mistress or
whatever”—he said this as if he had neither—“pardon again. Mo, to follow him
in one week, which they have not yet done, apparently. This information only
reached us yesterday, so we’ve a lot of footwork to do yet. Tarr instructed them,
Danny and her mother, that if by any chance he failed to make contact with
them, they should throw themselves on the mercy of one Peter Guillam. That’s
you, I believe.”

“If they were due three days ago, what’s happened to them?”

“Delayed. Missed their plane. Changed their plans. Lost their tickets. How the
hell do I know?”

“Or else the information’s wrong,” Guillam suggested.

“It isn’t,” Alleline snapped.

Resentment, mystification: Guillam clung to them both. “All right. The
Russians have turned Tarr round. They’ve sent his family over—God knows
why; I’d have thought they’d put them in the bank—and they’ve sent him, too.
Why’s it all so hot? What sort of plant can he be when we don’t believe a word
he says?”

This time, he noticed with exhilaration, his audience was watching Alleline,
who seemed to Guillam to be torn between giving a satisfactory but indiscreet
answer or making a fool of himself.

“Never mind what sort of plant! Muddying pools. Poisoning wells, maybe.
That damn sort. Pulling the rug out when we’re all but home and dry.” His
circulars read that way, too, thought Guillam. Metaphors chasing each other off
the page. “But just you remember this. At the first peep, before the first peep, at
the first whisper of him or his lady or his wee daughter, young Peter Guillam,
you come to one of us grown-ups. Anyone you see at this table. But not another
damn soul. Do you follow that injunction perfectly? Because there are more
damn wheels within wheels here than you can possibly guess or have any right
to know...”

It became suddenly a conversation in movement. Bland had plugged his hands
into his pockets and slouched across the room to lean against the far door.
Alleline had relit his pipe and was putting out the match with a long movement
of his arm while he glowered at Guillam through the smoke. “Who are you

courting these days, Peter—who’s the lucky wee lady?” Porteous was sliding a
sheet of paper down the table for Guillam’s signature. “For you, Peter, if you
please.” Paul Skordeno was whispering something into the ear of one of the
Russians, and Esterhase was at the door giving unpopular orders to the mothers.
Only Mo Delaware’s brown, unassuming eyes still held Guillam in their gaze.

“Read it first, won’t you,” Porteous advised silkily.

Guillam was halfway through the form already: “I certify that I have today
been advised of the contents of Witchcraft Report No. 308, Source Merlin,” ran
the first paragraph. “I undertake not to divulge any part of this report to other
members of the service, nor will I divulge the existence of Source Merlin. I also
undertake to report at once any matter which comes to my notice which appears
to bear on this material.”

The door had stayed open and, as Guillam signed, the second echelon of
London Station filed in, led by the mothers with trays of sandwiches. Diana
Dolphin, Lauder Strickland looking taut enough to blow up, the girls from
distribution, and a sour-faced old war-horse called Haggard, who was Ben
Thruxton’s overlord. Guillam left slowly, counting heads because he knew
Smiley would want to know who was there. At the door, to his surprise, he found
himself joined by Haydon, who seemed to have decided that the remaining
festivities were not for him.

“Stupid bloody cabaret,” Bill remarked, waving vaguely at the mothers.
“Percy’s getting more insufferable every day.”

“He does seem to,” said Guillam heartily.

“How’s Smiley these days? Seen much of him? You used to be quite a chum
of his, didn’t you?”

Guillam’s world, which was showing signs till then of steadying to a sensible
pace, plunged violently. “Afraid not,” he said; “he’s out of bounds.”

“Don’t tell me you take any notice of that nonsense,” Bill said, snorting. They
had reached the stairs. Haydon went ahead.

“How about you?” Guillam called. “Have you seen much of him?”

“And Ann’s flown the coop,” said Bill, ignoring the question. “Pushed off
with a sailor-boy or a waiter or something.” The door to his room was wide
open, the desk heaped with secret files. “Is that right?”

“I didn’t know,” said Guillam. “Poor old George.”

“Goffee?”

“I think I’ll get back, thanks.”

“For tea with Brother Tarr?”

“That’s right. At Fortnum’s. So long.”

In Archives Section, Alwyn was back from lunch. “Bag’s all gone, sir,” he

said gaily. “Should be over in Brixton by now.”

“Oh, damn,” said Guillam, firing his last shot. “There was something in it I
needed.”

A sickening notion had struck him: it seemed so neat and so horribly obvious
that he could only wonder why it had come to him so late. Sand was Camilla’s
husband. She was living a double life. Now whole new vistas of deceit opened
before him. His friends, his loves, even the Circus itself; joined and re-formed in
endless patterns of intrigue. A line of Mendel’s came back to him, dropped two
nights ago as they drank beer in some glum suburban pub: “Cheer up, Peter, old
son. Jesus Christ only had twelve, you know, and one of them was a double.”

Tarr, he thought. That bastard Ricki Tarr.
