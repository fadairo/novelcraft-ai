It was this long and cruel war that in its main battles Smiley now relived as he
embarked upon his reading. The files contained only the thinnest record of it; his
memory contained far more. Its protagonists were Alleline and Control, its
origins misty. Bill Haydon—a keen, if saddened, follower of those events—
maintained that the two men learned to hate each other at Cambridge during
Control’s brief spell as a don and Alleline’s as an undergraduate. According to
Bill, Alleline was Control’s pupil and a bad one, and Control taunted him, which
he certainly might have.

The story was grotesque enough for Control to play it up: “Percy and I are
blood brothers, I hear. We romped together in punts, imagine!” He never said
whether it was true.

To half-legend of that sort, Smiley could add a few hard facts from his
knowledge of the two men’s early lives. While Control was no man’s child,

Percy Alleline was a lowland Scot and a son of the Manse; his father was a
Presbyterian hammer, and if Percy did not have his faith, he had surely inherited
the faculty of bullish persuasion. He missed the war by a year or two and joined
the Circus from a City company. At Cambridge he had been a bit of a politician
(somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan, said Haydon who was himself. Lord
knows, no milk-and-water liberal) and a bit of an athlete. He was recruited by a
figure of no account called Maston, who for a short time contrived to build
himself a corner in counter-intelligence. Maston saw a great future in Alleline
and, having peddled his name furiously, fell from grace. Finding Alleline an
embarrassment. Circus personnel packed him off to South America, where he
did two full tours under consular cover without returning to England.

Even Control later admitted that Percy did extremely well there, Smiley
recalled. The Argentinians, liking his tennis and the way he rode, took him for a
gentleman—Control speaking—and assumed he was stupid, which Percy never
quite was. By the time he handed over to his successor, he had put together a
string of agents along both seaboards and was spreading his wings northward as
well. After home leave and a couple of weeks’ briefing, he was moved to India,
where his agents seemed to regard him as the reincarnation of the British Raj. He
preached loyalty to them, paid them next to nothing, and—when it suited him—
sold them down the river. From India he went to Cairo. That posting should have
been difficult for Alleline, if not impossible, for the Middle East till then had
been Haydon’s favourite stamping-ground. The Cairo networks looked on Bill

quite literally in the terms which Martindale had used of him that fateful night in
his anonymous dining-club: as a latter-day Lawrence of Arabia. They were all
set to make life hell for his successor. Yet somehow Percy bulldozed his way
through and, if he had only steered clear of the Americans, might have gone
down in memory as a better man than Haydon. Instead there was a scandal and
an open row between Percy and Control.

The circumstances were still obscure: the incident occurred long before
Smiley’s elevation as Control’s high chamberlain. With no authority from
London, it appeared, Alleline had involved himself in a silly American plot to
replace a local potentate with one of their own. Alleline had always had a fatal
reverence for the Americans. From Argentina he had observed with admiration
their rout of left-wing politicians around the hemisphere; in India he had
delighted in their skill at dividing the forces of centralisation. Whereas Control,
like most of the Circus, despised them and all their works, which he frequently
sought to undermine.

The plot aborted, the British oil companies were furious, and Alleline, as the
jargon happily puts it, had to leave in his socks. Later, Alleline claimed that
Control had urged him on, then pulled the rug out from under; even that he had
deliberately blown the plot to Moscow. However it was, Alleline reached
London to find a posting order directing him to the Nursery, where he was to
take over the training of greenhorn probationers. It was a slot normally reserved
for rundown contract men with a couple of years to go before their pension.
There were just so few jobs left in London those days for a man of Percy’s
seniority and talents, explained Bill Haydon, then head of personnel.

“Then you’ll damn well have to invent me one,” said Percy. He was right. As
Bill frankly confessed to Smiley some while later, he had reckoned without the
power of the Alleline lobby.

“But who are these people?” Smiley used to ask. “How can they force a man
on you when you don’t want him?”

“Golfers,” Control snapped. Golfers and conservatives, for Alleline in those
days was flirting with the opposition and was received with open arms, not least
by Miles Sercombe, Ann’s lamentably unremoved cousin and now Lacon’s
Minister. Yet Control had little power to resist. The Circus was in the doldrums
and there was loose talk of scrapping the existing outfit entirely and starting
elsewhere with a new one. Failures in that world occur traditionally in series, but
this had been an exceptionally long run. Product had slumped; more and more of
it had turned out to be suspect. In the places where it mattered. Control’s hand
was none too strong.

This temporary incapacity did not mar Control’s joy in the drafting of Percy

Alleline’s personal charter as Operational Director. He called it Percy’s Fool’s
Cap.

There was nothing Smiley could do. Bill Haydon was in Washington by then,
trying to renegotiate an intelligence treaty with what he called the Fascist
puritans of the American agency. But Smiley had risen to the fifth floor, and one
of his tasks was to keep petitioners off Control’s back. So it was to Smiley that
Alleline came to ask “Why?” Would call on him in his office when Control was
out, invite him to that dismal flat of his, having first sent his paramour to the
cinema, and interrogate him in his plaintive brogue. “Why?” He even invested in
a bottle of a malt whisky, which he forced on Smiley liberally while sticking to
the cheaper brand himself.

“What have I done to him, George, that’s so damn special? We’d a brush or
two—what’s so unusual to that, if you’ll tell me? Why does he pick on me? All I
want is a place at the top table. God knows my record entitles me to that!”

By top table, he meant the fifth floor.

The charter which Control had drafted for him, and which at a glance had a
most impressive shape, gave Alleline the right to examine all operations before
they were launched. The small print made this right conditional upon the consent
of the operational sections, and Control made sure that this was not forthcoming.
The charter invited him to “co-ordinate resources and break down regional
jealousies,” a concept Alleline had since achieved with the establishment of
London Station. But the resources sections, such as the lamplighters, the forgers,
the listeners, and the wranglers, declined to open their books to him and he
lacked the powers to force them. So Alleline starved; his trays were empty from
lunchtime onwards.

“I’m mediocre, is that it? We’ve all to be geniuses these days, prima donnas
and no damn chorus; old men, at that.” For Alleline, though it was easily
forgettable in him, was still a young man to be at the top table, with eight or ten
years to brandish over Haydon and Smiley, and more over Control.

Control was immovable: “Percy Alleline would sell his mother for a
knighthood and this service for a seat in the House of Lords.” And later, as his
hateful illness began creeping over him: “I refuse to bequeath my life’s work to a
parade horse. I’m too vain to be flattered, too old to be ambitious, and I’m ugly
as a crab. Percy’s quite the other way and there are enough witty men in
Whitehall to prefer his sort to mine.”

Which was how, indirectly. Control might be said to have brought Witchcraft
upon his own head.

“George, come in here,” Control snapped one day over the buzzer. “Brother
Percy’s trying to twist my tail. Come in here or there’ll be bloodshed.”

It was a time, Smiley remembered, when unsuccessful warriors were returning
from foreign parts. Roy Bland had just flown in from Belgrade, where with Toby
Esterhase’s help he had been trying to save the wreck of a dying network; Paul
Skordeno, at that time head German, had just buried his best Soviet agent in East
Berlin; and as to Bill, after another fruitless trip he was back in his pepper pot
room fuming about Pentagon arrogance. Pentagon idiocy. Pentagon duplicity,
and claiming that “the time had come to do a deal with the bloody Russians
instead.”

And in the Islay it was after midnight; a late guest was ringing the bell. Which
will cost him ten bob to Norman, thought Smiley, for whom the revised British
coinage was still something of a puzzle. With a sigh, he drew towards him the
first of the Witchcraft files, and, having vouchsafed a gingerly lick to his right
finger and thumb, set to work matching the official memory with his own.

“We spoke,” wrote Alleline, only a couple of months after that interview, in a
slightly hysterical personal letter addressed to Ann’s distinguished cousin the
Minister and entered on Lacon’s file. “Witchcraft reports derive from a source of
extreme sensitivity. To my mind, no existing method of Whitehall distribution
meets the case. The dispatch-box system which we used for GADFLY fell down
when keys were lost by Whitehall customers, or in one disgraceful case when an
overworked Under-Secretary gave his key to his personal assistant. I have
already spoken to Lilley, of naval intelligence, who is prepared to put at our
disposal a special reading-room in the Admiralty main building where the
material is made available to customers and watched over by a senior janitor of
this service. The reading-room will be known, for cover purposes, as the
conference room of the Adriatic Working Party, or the A.W.P. room for short.
Gustomers with reading rights will not have passes, since these also are open to
abuse. Instead they will identify themselves personally to my janitor”—Smiley
noted the pronoun—“who will be equipped with an indoctrination list illustrated
with customers’ photographs.”

Lacon, not yet convinced, to the Treasury through his odious master, the
Minister, on whose behalf his submissions were invariably made:

Even allowing that this is necessary, the reading-room will have to be
extensively rebuilt.

1. Will you authorise cost?

2. If so, the cost should seem to be borne by the Admiralty.

Department will covertly reimburse.

3. There is also the question of extra janitors, a further expense ...

And there is the question of Alleline’s greater glory, Smiley commented as he
slowly turned the pages. It shone already like a beacon everywhere: Percy is
heading for the top table and Control might already be dead.

From the stairwell came the sound of rather beautiful singing. A Welsh guest,
very drunk, was wishing everyone good night.

Witchcraft, Smiley recalled—his memory again, the files knew nothing so
plainly human—Witchcraft was by no means Percy Alleline’s first attempt, in
his new post, at launching his own operation; but since his charter bound him to
obtain Control’s approval, its predecessors had been stillborn. For a while, for
instance, he had concentrated on tunnelling. The Americans had built audio
tunnels in Berlin and Belgrade; the French had managed something similar
against the Americans. Very well, under Percy’s banner the Circus would get in
on the market. Control looked on benignly, an inter-services committee was
formed (known as the Alleline Committee), and a team of boffins from nuts and
bolts made a survey of the foundations of the Soviet Embassy in Athens, where
Alleline counted on the unstinted support of the latest military regime which,
like its predecessors, he greatly admired. Then, very gently. Control knocked
over Percy’s bricks and waited for him to come up with something new. Which,
after several shots between, was exactly what Percy was doing that grey morning
when Control peremptorily summoned Smiley to the feast.

Control was sitting at his desk, Alleline was standing at the window; between
them lay a plain folder, bright yellow and closed.

“Sit over there and take a look at this nonsense.”

Smiley sat in the easy chair and Alleline stayed at the window resting his big
elbows on the sill, staring over the rooftops to Nelson’s Column and the spires of
Whitehall beyond.

Inside the folder was a photograph of what purported to be a high-level Soviet
naval dispatch fifteen pages long.

“Who made the translation?” Smiley asked, thinking that it looked good
enough to be Roy Bland’s work.

“God,” Control replied. “God made it, didn’t he, Percy? Don’t ask him
anything, George, he won’t tell you.”

It was Control’s time for looking exceptionally youthful. Smiley remembered
how Control had lost weight, how his cheeks were pink, and how those who
knew him little tended to congratulate him on his good appearance. Only Smiley,
perhaps, ever noticed the tiny beads of sweat that in those days habitually
followed his hairline.

Precisely, the document was an appreciation, allegedly prepared for the Soviet
High Command, of a recent Soviet naval exercise in the Mediterranean and

Black Sea. In Lacon’s file it was entered simply as Report No. 1, under the title
“Naval.” For months the Admiralty had been screaming at the Circus for
anything relating to this exercise. It therefore had an impressive topicality, which
at once, in Smiley’s eyes, made it suspect. It was detailed but it dealt with
matters that Smiley did not understand even at a distance: shore-to-sea strike
power, radio activation of enemy alert procedures, the higher mathematics of the
balance of terror. If it was genuine it was gold-dust, but there was no earthly
reason to suppose it was genuine. Every week the Circus processed dozens of
unsolicited so-called Soviet documents. Most were straight pedlar material. A
few were deliberate plants by allies with an axe to grind; a few more were
Russian chicken-feed. Very rarely, one turned out to be sound, but usually after it
had been rejected.

“Whose initials are these?” Smiley asked, referring to some annotations
pencilled in Russian in the margin. “Does anyone know?”

Control tilted his head at Alleline. “Ask the authority. Don’t ask me.”

“Zharov,” said Alleline. “Admiral, Black Sea Fleet.”

“It’s not dated,” Smiley objected.

“It’s a draft,” Alleline replied complacently, his brogue richer than usual.
“Zharov signed it Thursday. The finished dispatch with those amendments went
out on circulation Monday, dated accordingly.”

Today was Tuesday.

“Where does it come from?” Smiley asked, still lost.

“Percy doesn’t feel able to tell,” said Control.

“What do our own evaluators say?”

“They’ve not seen it,” said Alleline, “and what’s more they’re not going to.”

Control said icily, “My brother in Christ, Lilley, of naval intelligence, has
passed a preliminary opinion, however, has he not, Percy? Percy showed it to
him last night—over a pink gin, was it, Percy, at the Travellers’?”

“At the Admiralty.”

“Brother Lilley, being a fellow Caledonian of Percy’s, is as a rule sparing in
his praise. However, when he telephoned me half an hour ago he was positively
fulsome. He even congratulated me. He regards the document as genuine and is
seeking our permission—Percy’s, I suppose I should say—to apprise his fellow
sea-lords of its conclusions.”

“Quite impossible,” said Alleline. “It’s for his eyes only, at least for a couple
more weeks.”

“The stuff is so hot,” Control explained, “that it has to be cooled off before it
can be distributed.”

“But where does it come from?” Smiley insisted.

“Oh, Percy’s dreamed up a cover name, don’t you worry. Never been slow on
cover names, have we, Percy?”

“But what’s the access? Who’s the case officer?”

“You’ll enjoy this,” Control promised, aside. He was extraordinarily angry. In
their long association Smiley could not remember him so angry. His slim,
freckled hands were shaking and his normally lifeless eyes were sparkling with
fury.

“Source Merlin,” Alleline said, prefacing the announcement with a slight but
very Scottish sucking of the teeth, “is a highly placed source with access to the
most sensitive levels of Soviet policy-making.” And, as if he were royalty: “We
have dubbed his product 'Witchcraft.’ ”

He had used the identical form of words, Smiley noticed, in a top-secret and
personal letter to a fan at the Treasury, requesting for himself greater discretion
in ad hoc payments to agents.

“He’ll be saying he won him at the football pool next,” Control warned, who
despite his second youth had an old man’s inaccuracy when it came to popular
idiom. “Now get him to tell you why he won’t tell you.”

Alleline was undeterred. He, too, was flushed, but with triumph, not disease.
He filled his big chest for a long speech, which he delivered entirely to Smiley,
tonelessly, rather as a Scottish police sergeant might give evidence before the
courts.

“The identity of Source Merlin is a secret which is not mine to divulge. He’s
the fruit of a long cultivation by certain people in this service. People who are
bound to me, as I am to them. People who are not at all entertained, either, by the
failure rate around this place. There’s been too much blown. Too much lost,
wasted, too many scandals. I’ve said so many times, but I might as well have
spoken to the wind for all the damn care he paid me.”

“He’s referring to me,” Control explained from the sidelines. “I am he in this
speech—you follow, George?”

“The ordinary principles of tradecraft and security have gone to the wall in
this service. Need to know: where is it? Compartmentation at all levels: where is
it, George? There’s too much regional backbiting, stimulated from the top.”

“Another reference to myself,” Control put in.

“Divide and rule, that’s the principle at work these days. Personalities who
should be helping to fight Communism are all at one another’s throats. We’re
losing our top partners.”

“He means the Americans,” Control explained.

“We’re losing our livelihood. Our self-respect. We’ve had enough.” He took
back the report and jammed it under his arm. “We’ve had a bellyful, in fact.”

“And like everyone who’s had enough,” said Control as Adeline noisily left
the room, “he wants more.”

Now for a while Lacon’s files, instead of Smiley’s memory, once more took
up the story. It was typical of the atmosphere of those last months that, having
been brought in on the affair at the beginning, Smiley should have received no
subsequent word of how it had developed. Control detested failure as he detested
illness, and his own failures most. He knew that to recognise failure was to live
with it; that a service that did not struggle did not survive. He detested the silk-
shirt agents, who hogged large chunks of the budget to the detriment of the
bread-and-butter networks in which he put his faith. He loved success, but he
detested miracles if they put the rest of his endeavour out of focus. He detested
weakness as he detested sentiment and religion, and he detested Percy Alleline,
who had a dash of most of them. His way of dealing with them was literally to
close the door: to withdraw into the dingy solitude of his upper rooms, receive
no visitors, and have all his phone calls fed to him by the mothers. The same
quiet ladies fed him jasmine tea and the countless office files that he sent for and
returned in heaps. Smiley would see them piled before the door as he went about
his own business of trying to keep the rest of the Circus afloat. Many were old,
from the days before Control led the pack. Some were personal, the biographies
of past and present members of the service.

Control never said what he was doing. If Smiley asked the mothers, or if Bill
Haydon sauntered in, favourite boy, and made the same enquiry, they only shook
their heads or silently raised their eyebrows towards paradise: “A terminal case,”
said these gentle glances. “We are humouring a great man at the end of his
career.” But Smiley—as he now patiently leafed through file after file, and in a
corner of his complex mind rehearsed Irina’s diary to Ricki Tarr—Smiley knew,
and in a quite real way took comfort from the knowledge, that he was not after
all the first to make this journey of exploration; that Control’s ghost was his
companion into all but the furthest reaches; and might even have stayed the
whole distance if Operation Testify, at the eleventh hour, had not stopped him
dead.

Breakfast again, and a much-subdued Welshman not drawn by undercooked
sausage and overcooked tomato.

“Do you want these back,” Lacon demanded, “or have you done with them?
They can’t be very enlightening, since they don’t even contain the reports.”

“Tonight, please, if you don’t mind.”

“I suppose you realise you look a wreck.”

He didn’t realise, but at Bywater Street, when he returned there, Ann’s pretty
gilt mirror showed his eyes red-rimmed and his plump cheeks clawed with
fatigue. He slept a little, then went his mysterious ways. When evening came,
Lacon was actually waiting for him. Smiley went straight on with his reading.

For six weeks, according to the files, the naval dispatch had no successor.
Other sections of the Ministry of Defence echoed the Admiralty’s enthusiasm for
the original dispatch; the Foreign Office remarked that “this document sheds an
extraordinary sidelight on Soviet aggressive thinking,” whatever that meant;
Alleline persisted in his demands for special handling of the material, but he was
like a general with no army. Lacon referred frostily to “the somewhat delayed
follow-up,” and suggested to his Minister that he should “defuse the situation
with the Admiralty.” From Control, according to the file, nothing. Perhaps he
was lying low and praying it would blow over. In the lull, a Treasury Moscow-
gazer sourly pointed out that Whitehall had seen plenty of this in recent years: an
encouraging first report, then silence or, worse, a scandal.

He was wrong. In the seventh week, Alleline announced publication of three
new Witchcraft reports all on the same day. All took the form of secret Soviet
interdepartmental correspondence, though the topics differed widely.

Witchcraft No. 2, according to Lacon’s summary, described tensions inside
Comecon and spoke of the degenerative effect of Western trade deals on its
weaker members. In Circus terms, this was a classic report from Roy Bland
territory, covering the very target that the Hungarian-based Aggravate network
had been attacking in vain for years. “Excellent tour d’horizon, ” wrote a Foreign
Office customer, “and backed by good collateral.”

Witchcraft No. 3 discussed revisionism in Hungary and Radar’s renewed
purges in political and academic life: the best way to end loose talk in Hungary,
said the author of the paper, borrowing a phrase coined by Khrushchev long
before, would be to shoot some more intellectuals. Once again this was Roy
Bland territory. “A salutary warning,” wrote the same Foreign Office
commentator, “to all those who like to think the Soviet Union is going soft on
satellites.”

These two reports were both in essence background, but Witchcraft No. 4 was
sixty pages long and held by the customers to be unique. It was an immensely
technical Soviet Foreign Service appreciation of the advantages and
disadvantages of negotiating with a weakened American President. The
conclusion, on balance, was that by throwing the President a bone for his own
electorate, the Soviet Union could buy useful concessions in forthcoming

discussions on multiple nuclear warheads. But it seriously questioned the
desirability of allowing the United States to feel too much the loser, since this
could tempt the Pentagon into a retributive or preemptive strike. The report was
from the very heart of Bill Haydon territory. But, as Haydon himself wrote in a
touching minute to Alleline (promptly copied, without Haydon’s knowledge, to
the Minister and entered on the Cabinet Office file), in twenty-five years of
attacking the Soviet nuclear target he had not laid his hands on anything of this
quality.

“Nor,” he concluded, “unless I am extremely mistaken, have our American
brothers-in-arms. I know that these are early days, but it does occur to me that
anyone taking this material to Washington could drive a very hard bargain in
return. Indeed, if Merlin maintains the standard, I would venture to predict that
we could buy anything there is to have in the American agency’s shop.”

Percy Alleline had his reading-room; and George Smiley made himself a
coffee on the derelict burner beside the washstand. Midway the meter ran out,
and in a temper he called for Norman and ordered five pounds’ worth of
shillings.
