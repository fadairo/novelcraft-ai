His destination was in Fleet Street, a ground-floor cellar full of wine barrels. In
other areas, three-thirty might be considered a little late for a pre-luncheon
aperitif, but as Smiley gently pushed open the door a dozen shadowy figures
turned to eye him from the bar. And at a corner table, as unremarked as the
plastic prison arches or the fake muskets on the wall, sat Jerry Westerby with a
very large pink gin.

“Old boy,” said Jerry Westerby shyly, in a voice that seemed to come out of
the ground. “Well, I’ll be damned. Hey, Jimmy!” His hand, which he laid on
Smiley’s arm while he signalled for refreshment with the other, was enormous
and cushioned with muscle, for Jerry had once been wicketkeeper for a county
cricket team. In contrast to other wicketkeepers he was a big man, but his
shoulders were still hunched from keeping his hands low. He had a mop of sandy
grey hair and a red face and he wore a famous sporting tie over a cream silk
shirt. The sight of Smiley clearly gave him great joy, for he was beaming with
pleasure.

“Well, I’ll be damned,” he repeated. “Of all the amazing things. Hey, what are
you doing these days,” dragging him forcibly into the seat beside him. “Sunning
your fanny, spitting at the ceiling? Hey”—a most urgent question—“what’ll it
be?”

Smiley ordered a Bloody Mary.

“It isn’t complete coincidence, Jerry,” Smiley confessed. There was a slight
pause between them, which Jerry was suddenly concerned to fill.

“Listen, how’s the demon wife? All well? That’s the stuff.One of the great
marriages, that one—always said so.”

Jerry Westerby himself had made several marriages but few that had given
him pleasure.

“Do a deal with you, George,” he proposed, rolling one great shoulder towards
him. “I’ll shack up with Ann and spit at the ceiling, you take my job and write
up the women’s Ping-Pong. How’s that? God bless.”

“Gheers,” said Smiley good-humouredly.

“Haven’t seen many of the boys and girls for a while, matter of fact,” Jerry
confessed awkwardly with an unaccountable blush. “Ghristmas card from old
Toby last year, that’s about my lot. Guess they’ve put me on the shelf as well.
Gan’t blame them.” He flicked the rim of his glass. “Too much of this stuff,
that’s what it is. They think I’ll blab. Grack up.”

“Fm sure they don’t,” said Smiley, and the silence reclaimed them both.

“Too much firewater not good for braves,” Jerry intoned solemnly. For years
they had had this Red Indian joke running, Smiley remembered with a sinking
heart.

“How, ” said Smiley.

“How, ” said Jerry, and they drank.

“I burnt your letter as soon as I’d read it,” Smiley went on in a quiet,
unbothered voice. “In case you wondered. I didn’t tell anyone about it at all. It
came too late, anyway. It was all over.”

At this, Jerry’s lively complexion turned a deep scarlet.

“So it wasn’t the letter you wrote me that put them off you,” Smiley continued
in the same very gentle voice, “if that’s what you were thinking. And, after all,
you did drop it in to me by hand.”

“Very decent of you,” Jerry muttered. “Thanks. Shouldn’t have written it.
Talking out of school.”

“Nonsense,” said Smiley as he ordered two more. “You did it for the good of
the service.”

To himself, saying this, Smiley sounded like Lacon. But the only way to talk
to Jerry was to talk like Jerry’s newspaper: short sentences; facile opinions.

Jerry expelled some breath and a lot of cigarette smoke. “Last job—oh, year
ago,” he recalled with a new airiness. “More. Dumping some little packet in
Budapest. Nothing to it, really. Phone box. Ledge at the top. Put my hand up.

Left it there. Kid’s play. Don’t think I muffed it or anything. Did my sums first—
all that. Safety signals. 'Box ready for emptying. Help yourself.’ The way they
taught us, you know. Still, you lads know best, don’t you? You’re the owls. Do
one’s bit, that’s the thing. Can’t do more. All part of a pattern. Design.”

“They’ll be beating the doors down for you soon,” said Smiley consolingly. “I
expect they’re resting you up for a season. They do that, you know.”

“Hope so,” said Jerry with a loyal, very diffident smile. His glass shook
slightly as he drank.

“Was that the trip you made just before you wrote to me?” Smiley asked.

“Sure. Same trip, actually; Budapest, then Prague.”

“And it was in Prague that you heard this story? The story you referred to in
your letter to me?”

At the bar a florid man in a black suit was predicting the imminent collapse of
the nation. He gave it three months, he said, then curtains.

“Rum chap, Toby Esterhase,” said Jerry.

“But good,” said Smiley.

“Oh, my God, old boy, first rate. Brilliant, my view. But rum, you know.

How. ” They drank again, and Jerry Westerby loosely poked a finger behind his
head, in imitation of an Apache feather.

“Trouble is,” the florid man at the bar was saying over the top of his drink,

“we won’t even know it’s happened.”

They decided to lunch straight away, because Jerry had a story to file for
tomorrow’s edition about some top footballer who’d been caught shoplifting.
They went to a curry house where the management was content to serve beer at
teatime, and they agreed that if anyone bumped into them Jerry would introduce
George as his bank manager, a notion that tickled him repeatedly throughout his
hearty meal. There was background music, which Jerry called the connubial
flight of the mosquito, and at times it threatened to drown the fainter notes of his
husky voice. Which was probably just as well, for while Smiley made a brave
show of enthusiasm for the curry, Jerry was launched, after his initial reluctance,
upon quite a different story, concerning one Jim Ellis: the story that dear old
Toby Esterhase had refused to let him print.

Jerry Westerby was that extremely rare person, the perfect witness. He had no
fantasy, no malice, no personal opinion. Merely, the thing was rum. He couldn’t
get it off his mind and, come to think of it, he hadn’t spoken to Toby since.

“Just this card, you see, 'Happy Christmas, Toby’—picture of Leadenhall
Street in the snow.” He gazed in great perplexity at the electric fan. “Nothing
special about Eeadenhall Street, is there, old boy? Not a spy-house or a meeting
place or something, is it?”

“Not that I know of,” said Smiley, with a laugh.

“Couldn’t think why he chose Leadenhall Street for a Christmas card.

Damned odd, don’t you think?”

Perhaps he just wanted a snowy picture of London, Smiley suggested; Toby,
after all, was quite foreign in lots of ways.

“Rum way to keep in touch, I must say. Used to send me a crate of Scotch
regular as clockwork.” Jerry frowned and drank from his krug. “It’s not the
Scotch I mind,” he explained with that puzzlement that often clouded the greater
visions of his life; “buy my own Scotch any time. It’s just that when you’re on
the outside, you think everything has a meaning, so presents are important—see
what I’m getting at?”

It was a year ago—well, December. The Restaurant Sport in Prague, said Jerry
Westerby, was a bit off the track of your average Western journalist. Most of
them hung around the Cosmo or the International, talking in low murmurs and
keeping together because they were jumpy. But Jerry’s local was the Sport, and
ever since he had taken Holotek, the goalie, along after the winning match

against the Tartars, Jerry had had the big hand from the barman, whose name
was Stanislaus or Stan.

“Stan’s a perfect prince. Does just what he damn well pleases. Makes you
suddenly think Czecho’s a free country.”

Restaurant, he explained, meant bar. Whereas bar in Czecho meant nightclub,
which was rum. Smiley agreed that it must be confusing.

All the same, Jerry always kept an ear to the ground when he went there; after
all, it was Czecho, and once or twice he’d been able to bring back the odd
snippet for Toby or put him onto the track of someone.

“Even if it was just currency-dealing, black-market stuff. All grist to the mill,
according to Tobe. These little scraps add up—that’s what Tobe said, anyway.”

Quite right, Smiley agreed. That was the way it worked.

“Tobe was the owl, what?”

“Sure.”

“I used to work straight to Roy Bland, you see. Then Roy got kicked upstairs,
so Tobe took me over. Bit unsettling, actually, changes. Cheers.”

“How long had you been working to Toby when this trip took place?”

“Couple of years, not more.”

There was a pause while food came and krugs were refilled and Jerry
Westerby with his enormous hands shattered a popadam onto the hottest curry on
the menu, then spread a crimson sauce over the top. The sauce, he said, was to
give it bite. “Old Khan runs it up for me specially,” he explained, aside. “Keeps
it in a deep shelter.”

So anyway, he resumed, that night in Stan’s bar there was this young boy with
the pudding-bowl haircut and the pretty girl on his arm.

“And I thought. Watch out, Jerry, boy; that’s an army haircut. Right?”

“Right,” Smiley echoed, thinking that in some ways Jerry was a bit of an owl
himself.

It turned out the boy was Stan’s nephew, and very proud of his English.
“Amazing what people will tell you if it gives them a chance of showing off their
languages.” He was on leave from the army and he’d fallen in love with this girl;
he’d eight days to go and the whole world was his friend, Jerry included. Jerry
particularly, in fact, because Jerry was paying for the booze.

“So we’re all sitting hugger-mugger at the big table in the corner—students,
pretty girls, all sorts. Old Stan had come round from behind the bar and some
laddie was doing a fair job with a squeeze-box. Bags of Gemiltlichkeit, bags of
booze, bags of noise.”

The noise was specially important, Jerry explained, because it let him chat to
the boy without anyone else paying attention. The boy was sitting next to Jerry;

he’d taken a shine to him from the start. He had one arm slung round the girl and
one arm round Jerry.

“One of those kids who can touch you without giving you the creeps. Don’t
like being touched, as a rule. Greeks do it. Hate it, personally.”

Smiley said he hated it, too.

“Come to think of it, the girl looked a bit like Ann,” Jerry reflected. “Foxy—
know what I mean? Garbo eyes, lots of oomph.”

So while everyone was carrying on, singing and drinking and playing kiss-in-
the-ring, this lad asked Jerry whether he would like to know the truth about Jim
Ellis.

“Pretended I’d never heard of him,” Jerry explained to Smiley. “ 'Love to,’ I
said. 'Who’s Jim Ellis when he’s at home?’ And the boy looks at me as if I’m
daft and says, 'A British spy.’ Only no one else heard, you see; they were all
yelling and singing saucy songs. He had the girl’s head on his shoulder, but she
was half cut and in her seventh heaven, so he just went on talking to me, proud
of his English, you see.”

“I get it,” said Smiley.

“ 'British spy.’ Yells straight into my ear-hole. 'Fought with Czech partisans in
the war. Came here calling himself Hajek and was shot by the Russian secret
police.’ So I just shrugged and said, 'News to me, old boy.’ Not pushing, you
see. Mustn’t be pushy, ever. Scares them off.”

“You’re absolutely right,” said Smiley wholeheartedly, and for an interlude
patiently parried further questions about Ann, and what it was like to love—
really to love—the other person all your life.

“I am a conscript,” the boy began, according to Jerry Westerby. “I have to serve
in the army or I can’t go to university.” In October he had been on basic-training
manoeuvres in the forests near Brno. There was always a lot of military in the
woods there; in summer the whole area was closed to the public for a month at a
time. He was on a boring infantry exercise that was supposed to last two weeks,
but on the third day it was called off for no reason and the troops were ordered
back to town. That was the order: pack now and get back to barracks. The whole
forest was to be cleared by dusk.

“Within hours, every sort of daft rumour was flying around,” Jerry went on.
“Some fellow said the ballistics research station at Tisnov had blown up.
Somebody else said the training battalions had mutinied and were shooting up
the Russian soldiers. Fresh uprising in Prague, Russians taken over the
government, the Germans had attacked—God knows what hadn’t happened. You
know what soldiers are. Same everywhere, soldiers. Gossip till the cows come

home.”

The reference to the army moved Jerry Westerby to ask after certain
acquaintances from his military days, people Smiley had dimly known, and
forgotten. Finally they resumed.

“They broke camp, packed the lorries, and sat about waiting for the convoy to
get moving. They’d gone half a mile when everything stopped again and the
convoy was ordered off the road. Lorries had to duckshuffle into the trees. Got
stuck in the mud, ditches, every damn thing. Chaos, apparently.”

It was the Russians, said Westerby. They were coming from the direction of
Brno, and they were in a very big hurry and everything that was Czech had to
get out of the light or take the consequences.

“First came a bunch of motorcycles tearing down the track with lights flashing
and the drivers screaming at them. Then a staff car and civilians—the boy
reckoned six civilians altogether. Then two lorryloads of special troops armed to
the eyebrows and wearing combat paint. Finally a truck full of tracker dogs. All
making a most God-awful row. Not boring you am I, old boy?”

Westerby dabbed the sweat from his face with a handkerchief and blinked like
someone coming round. The sweat had come through his silk shirt as well; he
looked as if he had been under a shower. Curry not being a food he cared for,
Smiley ordered two more krugs to wash away the taste.

“So that was the first part of the story. Czech troops out, Russian troops in.

Got it?”

Smiley said yes, he thought he had his mind round it so far.

Back in Brno, however, the boy quickly learned that his unit’s part in the
proceedings was nowhere near done. Their convoy was joined up with another,
and the next night for eight or ten hours they tore round the countryside with no
apparent destination. They drove west to Trebic, stopped and waited while the
signals section made a long transmission; then they cut back south east nearly as
far as Znojmo on the Austrian border, signalling like mad as they went. No one
knew who had ordered the route; no one would explain a thing. At one point
they were ordered to fix bayonets; at another they pitched camp, then packed up
all their kit again and pushed off. Here and there they met up with other units:
near Breclav marshalling-yards, tanks going round in circles, once a pair of self-
propelled guns on pre-laid track. Everywhere the story was the same: chaotic,
pointless activity. The older hands said it was a Russian punishment for being
Czech. Back in Brno again, the boy heard a different explanation. The Russians
were after a British spy called Hajek. He’d been spying on the research station
and tried to kidnap a general and the Russians had shot him.

“So the boy asked, you see,” said Jerry. “Sassy little devil asked his sergeant.

'If Hajek is already shot, why do we have to tear round the countryside creating
an uproar?’ And the sergeant told him, 'Because it’s the army.’ Sergeants all over
the world, what?”

Very quietly Smiley asked, “We’re talking about two nights, Jerry. Which
night did the Russians move into the forest?”

Jerry Westerby screwed up his face in perplexity. “That’s what the boy wanted
to tell me, you see, George. That’s what he was trying to put over in Stan’s bar.
What all the rumours were about. The Russians moved in on Friday. They didn’t
shoot Hajek till Saturday. So the wise lads were saying: there you are, Russians
were waiting for Hajek to turn up. Knew he was coming. Knew the lot. Lay in
wait. Bad story, you see. Bad for our reputation—see what I mean? Bad for big
chief. Bad for tribe. How. ”

“How, ” said Smiley, into his beer.

“That’s what Toby felt, too, mind. We saw it the same way; we just reacted
differently.”

“So you told all to Toby,” said Smiley lightly, as he passed Jerry a large dish
of dal. “You had to see him anyway to tell him you’d dropped the package for
him in Budapest, so you told him the Hajek story, too.”

Well, that was just it, said Jerry. That was the thing that had bothered him, the
thing that was rum, the thing that made him write to George, actually. “Old Tobe
said it was tripe. Got all regimental and nasty. First he was keen as mustard,
clapping me on the back, and Westerby for mayor. He went back to the shop, and
next morning he threw the book at me. Emergency meeting, drove me round and
round the park in a car, yelling blue murder. Said I was so plastered these days I
didn’t know fact from fiction. All that stuff. Made me a bit shirty, actually.”

“I expect you wondered who he’d been talking to in between,” said Smiley
sympathetically. “What did he say exactly, ” he asked, not in any intense way but
as if he just wanted to get it all crystal clear in his mind.

“Told me it was most likely a put-up ploy. Boy was a provocateur. Disruption
job to make the Gircus chase its own tail. Tore my ears off for disseminating
half-baked rumours. I said to him, George: 'Old boy,’ I said. 'Tobe, I was only
reporting, old boy. No need to get hot under the collar. Yesterday you thought I
was the cat’s whiskers. No point in turning round and shooting the messenger. If
you’ve decided you don’t like the story, that’s your business.’ Wouldn’t sort of
listen any more—know what I mean? Illogical, I thought it was. Bloke like that.
Hot one minute and cold the next. Not his best performance—know what I
mean?”

With his left hand Jerry rubbed the side of his head, like a schoolboy
pretending to think. “ 'Okie-dokie,’ I said, 'forget it. I’ll write it up for the rag.

Not the part about the Russians getting there first. The other part. “Dirty work in
the forest,” that sort of tripe.’ I said to him, Tf it isn’t good enough for the
Circus, it’ll do for the rag.’ Then he went up the wall again. Next day some owl
rings the old man. Keep that baboon Westerby off the Ellis story. Rub his nose in
the D notice: formal warning. 'All further references to Jim Ellis alias Hajek
against the national interest, so put ’em on the spike.’ Back to women’s Ping-
Pong. Cheers.”

“But by then you’d written to me,” Smiley reminded him.

Jerry Westerby blushed terribly. “Sorry about that,” he said. “Got all
xenophobe and suspicious. Comes from being on the outside: you don’t trust
your best friends. Trust them—well, less than strangers.” He tried again: “Just
that I thought old Tobe was going a bit haywire. Shouldn’t have done it, should
I? Against the rules.” Through his embarrassment he managed a painful grin.
“Then I heard on the grapevine that the firm had given you the heave-ho, so I
felt an even bigger damn fool. Not hunting alone, are you, old boy? Not...” He
left the question unasked; but not, perhaps, unanswered.

As they parted, Smiley took him gently by the arm.

“If Toby should get in touch with you, I think it better if you don’t tell him we
met today. He’s a good fellow but he does tend to think people are ganging up on
him.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it, old boy.”

“And if he does get in touch in the next few days,” Smiley went on—in that
remote contingency, his tone suggested—“you could even warn me, actually.
Then I can back you up. Don’t ring me, come to think of it, ring this number.”

Suddenly Jerry Westerby was in a hurry; that story about the shoplifting
footballer couldn’t wait. But as he accepted Smiley’s card he did ask with a
queer, embarrassed glance away from him, “Nothing untoward going on is there,
old boy? No dirty work at the crossroads?” The grin was quite terrible. “Tribe
hasn’t gone on the rampage or anything?”

Smiley laughed and lightly laid a hand on Jerry’s enormous, slightly hunched
shoulder.

“Any time,” said Westerby.

“I’ll remember.”

“I thought it was you, you see: you who telephoned the old man.”

“It wasn’t.”

“Maybe it was Alleline.”

“I expect so.”

“Any time,” said Westerby again. “Sorry, you know. Love to Ann.” He
hesitated.

“Come on, Jerry, out with it,” said Smiley.

“Toby had some bad story about her and Bill the Brain. I told him to stuff it up
his shirt-front. Nothing to it, is there?”

“Thanks, Jerry. So long. How. ”

“I knew there wasn’t,” said Jerry, very pleased, and lifting his finger to denote
the feather, padded off into his own reserves.
