PART III

30

In Jim Prideaux’s world, Thursday had gone along like any other, except that
some time in the small hours of the morning the wounds in his shoulder-bone
started leaking, he supposed because of the inter-house run on Wednesday
afternoon. He was woken by the pain, and by the draught on the wet of his back
where the discharge flowed. The other time this happened he had driven himself
to Taunton General, but the nurses took one look at him and slapped him into
emergency to wait for doctor somebody and an X-ray, so he filched his clothes
and left. He’d done with hospitals and he’d done with medicos. English
hospitals, other hospitals—Jim had done with them. They called the discharge a
“track.”

He couldn’t reach the wound to treat it, but after last time he had hacked
himself triangles of lint and stitched strings to the corners. Having put these
handy on the draining board and prepared the hibitane, he heated hot water,
added half a packet of salt, and gave himself an improvised shower, crouching to
get his back under the jet. He soaked the lint in the hibitane, flung it across his
back, strapped it from the front, and lay face down on the bunk with a vodka
handy. The pain eased and a drowsiness came over him, but he knew if he gave
way to it he would sleep all day, so he took the vodka bottle to the window and
sat at the table correcting Five B French while Thursday’s dawn slipped into the
Dip and the rooks started their clatter in the elms.

Sometimes he thought of the wound as a memory he couldn’t keep down. He
tried his damnedest to patch it over and forget, but even his damnedest wasn’t
always enough.

He took the correcting slowly because he liked it, and because correcting kept
his mind in the right places. At six-thirty, seven, he was done so he put on some
old flannel bags and a sports coat and walked quietly down to the church, which
was never locked. There he knelt a moment in the centre aisle of the Curtois
antechapel, which was a family monument to the dead from two wars, and
seldom visited by anyone. The cross on the little altar had been carved by
sappers at Verdun. Still kneeling, Jim groped cautiously under the pew until his
fingertips discovered the line of several pieces of adhesive tape, and following
these, a casing of cold metal. His devotions over, he bashed up Combe Fane to
the hilltop, jogging a bit to get a sweat running, because the warm did him
wonders while it lasted, and rhythm soothed his vigilance.

After his sleepless night and the early-morning vodka, he was feeling a bit

light-headed, so when he saw the ponies down the combe, gawping at him with
their fool faces, he yelled at them in bad Somerset—“Git ’an there! Damned old
fools, take your silly eyes off me! ”—before pounding down the lane again for
coffee, and a change of bandage.

First lesson after prayers was Five B French, and there Jim all but lost his
temper: doled out a silly punishment to damn-fool Clements, draper’s son; had to
take it back at the end of class. In the common-room he went through another
routine, of the sort he had followed in the church: quickly, mindlessly, no fumble
and out. It was a simple enough notion, the mail check, but it worked. He’d
never heard of anyone else who used it, among the pros, but then pros don’t talk
about their game. “See it this way,” he would have said. “If the opposition is
watching you, it’s certain to be watching your mail, because mail’s the easiest
watch in the game—easier still if the opposition is the home side and has the co¬
operation of the postal service. So what do you do? Every week, from the same
post-box, at the same time, at the same rate, you post one envelope to yourself
and a second to an innocent party at the same address. Shove in a bit of trash—
charity Christmas-card literature, come-on from local supermarket—be sure to
seal envelope, stand back and compare times of arrival. If your letter turns up
later than the other feller’s, you’ve just felt someone’s hot breath on you—in this
case, Toby’s.”

Jim called it, in his odd, chipped vocabulary, water-testing, and once again the
temperature was unobjectionable. The two letters clocked in together, but Jim
arrived too late to pinch back the one addressed to Marjoribanks, whose turn it
was to act as unwitting running mate. So, having pocketed his own, Jim snorted
at the Daily Telegraph while Marjoribanks, with an irritable “Oh, to hell,” tore
up a printed invitation to join the Bible Reading Fellowship. From there, school
routine carried him again till junior rugger versus St. Ermin’s, which he was
billed to referee. It was a fast game and when it was over his back acted up
again, so he drank vodka till first bell, which he’d promised to take for young
Elwes. He couldn’t remember why he’d promised, but the younger staff and
specially the married ones relied on him a lot for odd jobs and he let it happen.
The bell was an old ship’s tocsin, something Thursgood’s father had dug up and
now part of the tradition. As Jim rang it, he was aware of little Bill Roach
standing right beside him, peering up at him with a white smile, wanting his
attention, as he wanted it half a dozen times each day.

“Hullo, there, Jumbo, what’s your headache this time?”

“Sir, please, sir.”

“Come on, Jumbo, out with it.”

“Sir, there’s someone asking where you live, sir,” said Roach.

Jim put down the bell.

“What sort of someone, Jumbo? Come on, I won’t bite you, come on, hey ...
hey! What sort of someone? Man someone? Woman? Juju man? Hey! Come on,
old feller,” he said softly, crouching to Roach’s height. “No need to cry. What’s
the matter, then? Got a temperature?” He pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve.
“What sort of someone?” he repeated in the same low voice.

“He asked at Mrs. McCullum’s. He said he was a friend. Then he got back
into his car; it’s parked in the churchyard, sir.” A fresh gust of tears. “He’s just
sitting in it.”

“Get the hell away, damn you!” Jim called to a bunch of seniors grinning in a
doorway. “Get the hell!” He went back to Roach. “Tall friend?” he asked softly.
“Sloppy tall kind of fellow, Jumbo? Eyebrows and a stoop? Thin feller?
Bradbury, come here and stop gawping! Stand by to take Jumbo up to Matron!
Thin feller?” he asked again, very steady.

But Roach had run out of words. He had no memory any more, no sense of
size or perspective; his faculty of selection in the adult world had gone. Big men,
small men, old, young, crooked, straight—they were a single army of
indistinguishable dangers. To say no to Jim was more than he could bear; to say
yes was to shoulder the whole awful responsibility of disappointing him. He saw
Jim’s eyes on him; he saw the smile go out and he felt the merciful touch of a big
hand upon his arm.

“Attaboy, Jumbo. Nobody ever watched like you, did they?”

Laying his head hopelessly against Bradbury’s shoulder. Bill Roach closed his
eyes. When he opened them, he saw through his tears that Jim was already
halfway up the staircase.

Jim felt calm; almost easy. For days he had known there was someone. That also
was part of his routine: to watch the places where the watchers asked. The
church, where the ebb and flow of the local population is a ready topic; county
hall, register of electors; tradesmen, if they kept customer accounts; pubs, if the
quarry didn’t use them. In England, he knew these were the natural traps that
watchers automatically patrolled before they closed on you. And, sure enough, in
Taunton two days ago, chatting pleasantly with the assistant librarian, Jim had
come across the footprint he was looking for. A stranger, apparently down from
London, had been interested in village wards; yes, a political gentleman—well,
more in the line of political research, he was—professional, you could tell—and
one of the things he had wanted—fancy that, now—was the up-to-date record of
Jim’s very village—yes, the voters’ list—as they were thinking of making a
door-to-door survey of a really out-of-the-way community, specially new

immigrants . . . Yes, fancy that, Jim agreed, and, from then on, made his
dispositions. He bought railway tickets to places—Taunton to Exeter, Taunton to
London, Taunton to Swindon, valid one month—because he knew that if he were
on the run again, tickets would be hard to come by. He had uncached his old
identities and his gun, and hid them handily above ground; he dumped a suitcase
full of clothes in the boot of the Alvis, and kept the tank full. These precautions
eased his fears a little, made sleep a possibility; or would have done, before his
back.

“Sir, who won, sir?”

Prebble, a new boy, in dressing gown and toothpaste, on his way to surgery.
Sometimes boys spoke to Jim for no reason; his size and crookedness were a
challenge.

“Sir, the match, sir, versus Saint Ermin’s.”

“Saint Vermin’s, ” another boy piped. “Yes, sir, who won, actually?”

“Sir, they did, sir,” Jim barked. “As you’d have known, sir, if you’d been
watching, sir, ” and swinging an enormous fist at them in a slow feinted punch,
he propelled both boys across the corridor to Matron’s dispensary.

“Night, sir.”

“Night, you toads,” Jim sang, and stepped the other way into the sick-bay for
a view of the church and the cemetery. The sick-bay was unlit; it had a look and
a stink he hated. Twelve boys lay in the gloom, dozing between supper and
temperatures.

“Who’s that?” asked a hoarse voice.

“Rhino,” said another. “Hey, Rhino, who won against Saint Vermin’s?”

To call Jim by his nickname was insubordinate, but boys in sick-bay feel free
from discipline.

“Rhino? Who the hell’s Rhino? Don’t know him. Not a name to me,” Jim
snorted, squeezing between two beds. “Put that torch away—not allowed. Damn
walk-over, that’s who won. Eighteen to nothing for Vermin’s.” That window
went down almost to the floor. An old fireguard protected it from boys. “Too
much damn fumble in the three-quarter line,” he muttered, peering down.

“I hate rugger,” said a boy called Stephen.

The blue Ford was parked in the shadow of the church, close in under the
elms. From the ground floor it would have been out of sight but it didn’t look
hidden. Jim stood very still, a little back from the window, studying it for telltale
signs. The light was fading fast, but his eyesight was good and he knew what to
look for: discreet aerial, second inside mirror for the legman, burn marks under

the exhaust. Sensing the tension in him, the boys became facetious.

“Sir, is it a bird, sir? Is she any good, sir?”

“Sir, are we on fire?”

“Sir, what are her legs like?”

“Gosh, sir, don’t say it’s Miss Aaronson?” At this everyone started giggling,
because Miss Aaronson was old and ugly.

“Shut up,” Jim snapped, quite angry. “Rude pigs, shut up.” Downstairs in
assembly, Thursgood was calling senior roll before prep.

Abercrombie? Sir. Astor? Sir. Blakeney? Sick, sir.

Still watching, Jim saw the car door open and George Smiley climb cautiously
out, wearing a heavy overcoat.

Matron’s footsteps sounded in the corridor. He heard the squeak of her rubber
heels and the rattle of thermometers in a paste pot.

“My good Rhino, whatever are you doing in my sick-bay? And close that
curtain, you bad boy—you’ll have the whole lot of them dying of pneumonia.
William Merridew, sit up at once.”

Smiley was locking the car door. He was alone and he carried nothing, not
even a briefcase.

“They’re screaming for you in Grenville, Rhino.”

“Going, gone,” Jim retorted briskly and with a jerky “Night, all,” he humped
his way to Grenville dormitory, where he was pledged to finish a story by John
Buchan. Reading aloud, he noticed that there were certain sounds he had trouble
pronouncing; they caught somewhere in his throat. He knew he was sweating, he
guessed his back was seeping, and by the time he had finished there was a
stiffness round his jaw that was not just from reading aloud. But all these things
were small symptoms beside the rage that was mounting in him as he plunged
into the freezing night air. For a moment, on the overgrown terrace, he hesitated,
staring at the church. It would take him three minutes, less, to untape the gun
from underneath the pew, shove it into the waistband of his trousers, left side,
butt inward to the groin . . .

But instinct advised him “no,” so he set course directly for the trailer, singing
“Hey, diddle-diddle” as loud as his tuneless voice would carry.
