It was lunchtime next day. Smiley had read and slept a little, read again and
bathed, and as he climbed the steps to that pretty London house he felt pleased,
because he liked Sam.

The house was brown brick and Georgian, just off Grosvenor Square. There
were five steps and a brass doorbell in a scalloped recess. The door was black,
with pillars either side. He pushed the bell and he might as well have pushed the
door; it opened at once. He entered a circular hallway with another door the
other end, and two large men in black suits who might have been ushers at
Westminster Abbey. Over a marble chimney-piece, horses pranced and they
might have been Stubbs. One man stood close while he took off his coat; the
second led him to a Bible desk to sign the book.

“Hebden,” Smiley murmured as he wrote, giving a workname Sam could
remember.

“Adrian Hebden.”

The man who had his coat repeated the name into a house telephone:

“Mr. Hebden—Mr. Adrian Hebden.”

“if you wouldn’t mind waiting one second, sir,” said the man by the Bible
desk. There was no music, and Smiley had the feeling there should have been;
also a fountain.

“I’m a friend of Mr. Gollins’s, as a matter of fact,” said Smiley, “if Mr. Gollins
is available. 1 think he may even be expecting me.”

The man at the telephone murmured, “Thank you,” and hung it on the hook.
He led Smiley to the inner door and pushed it open, it made no sound at all, not
even a rustle on the silk carpet.

“Mr. Gollins is over there, sir,” he murmured respectfully. “Drinks are with the
courtesy of the house.”

The three reception rooms had been run together, with pillars and arches to
divide them optically, and mahogany panelling, in each room was one table, the
third was sixty feet away. The lights shone on meaningless pictures of fruit in
colossal gold frames, and on the green baize tablecloths. The curtains were
drawn, the tables about one third occupied, four or five players to each, all men,
but the only sounds were the click of the ball in the wheel, the click of the chips
as they were redistributed, and the very low murmur of the croupiers.

“Adrian Hebden,” said Sam Gollins, with a twinkle in his voice. “Long time
no see.”

“Hullo, Sam,” said Smiley, and they shook hands.

“Come down to my lair,” said Sam, and nodded to the only other man in the
room who was standing, a very big man with blood pressure and a chipped face.
The big man nodded, too.

“Care for it?” Sam enquired as they crossed a corridor draped in red silk.

“It’s very impressive,” said Smiley politely.

“That’s the word,” said Sam. “Impressive. That’s what it is.” He was wearing
a dinner jacket. His office was done in Edwardian plush, his desk had a marble
top and ball-and-claw feet, but the room itself was very small and not at all well
ventilated—more like the back room of a theatre, Smiley thought, furnished with
leftover props.

“They might even let me put in a few pennies of my own later, give it another
year. They’re toughish boys, but very go-ahead, you know.”

“I’m sure,” said Smiley.

“Like we were in the old days.”

“That’s right.”

He was trim and lighthearted in his manner and he had a trim black
moustache. Smiley couldn’t imagine him without it. He was probably fifty. He
had spent a lot of time out East, where they had once worked together on a
catch-and-carry job against a Chinese radio operator. His complexion and hair
were greying but he still looked thirty-five. His smile was warm and he had a
confiding, messroom friendliness. He kept both hands on the table as if he were
at cards, and he looked at Smiley with a possessive fondness that was paternal or
filial or both.

“If chummy goes over five,” he said, still smiling, “give me a buzz, Harry,
will you? Otherwise keep your big mouth shut; I’m chatting up an oil king.” He
was talking into a box on his desk. “Where is he now?”

“Three up,” said a gravel voice. Smiley guessed it belonged to the chipped
man with blood pressure.

“Then he’s got eight to lose,” said Sam blandly. “Keep him at the table, that’s
all. Make a hero of him.” He switched off and grinned. Smiley grinned back.

“Really, it’s a great life,” Sam assured him. “Better than selling washing
machines, anyway. Bit odd, of course, putting on the dinner jacket at ten in the
morning. Reminds one of diplomatic cover.” Smiley laughed. “Straight, too,
believe it or not,” Sam added with no change to his expression. “We get all the
help we need from the arithmetic.”

“I’m sure you do,” said Smiley, once more with great politeness.

“Care for some music?”

It was canned and came out of the ceiling. Sam turned it up as loud as they

could bear.

“So what can I do you for?” Sam asked, the smile broadening.

“I want to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was shot. You were duty
officer.”

Sam smoked brown cigarettes that smelt of cigar. Lighting one, he let the end
catch fire, then watched it die to an ember. “Writing your memoirs, old boy?” he
enquired.

“We’re reopening the case.”

“What’s this we, old boy?”

“I, myself, and me, with Lacon pushing and the Minister pulling.”

“All power corrupts but some must govern, and in that case Brother Lacon
will reluctantly scramble to the top of the heap.”

“It hasn’t changed,” said Smiley.

Sam drew ruminatively on his cigarette. The music switched to phrases of
Noel Coward.

“It’s a dream of mine, actually,” said Sam Collins through the smoke. “One of
these days Percy Alleline walks through that door with a shabby brown suitcase
and asks for a flutter. He puts the whole of the secret vote on red and loses.”

“The record’s been filleted,” said Smiley. “It’s a matter of going to people and
asking what they remember. There’s almost nothing on file at all.”

“I’m not surprised,” said Sam. Over the phone he ordered sandwiches. “Live
on them,” he explained. “Sandwiches and canapes. One of the perks.”

He was pouring coffee when the red pinlight glowed between them on the
desk.

“Chummy’s even,” said the gravel voice.

“Then start counting,” said Sam, and closed the switch.

He told it plainly but precisely, the way a good soldier recalls a battle, not to
win or lose any more, but simply to remember. He had just come back from
abroad, he said; a three-year stint in Vientiane. He’d checked in with personnel
and cleared himself with the Dolphin; no one seemed to have any plans for him,
so he was thinking of taking off for the South of France for a month’s leave
when MacFadean, that old janitor who was practically Control’s valet, scooped
him up in the corridor and marched him to Control’s room.

“This was which day, exactly?” said Smiley.

“October 19th.”

“The Thursday.”

“The Thursday. I was thinking of flying to Nice on Monday. You were in
Berlin. I wanted to buy you a drink but the mothers said you were occupe, and
when I checked with Movements they told me you’d gone to Berlin.”

“Yes, that’s true,” Smiley said simply. “Control sent me there.”

To get me out of the way, he might have added; it was a feeling he had had
even at the time.

“I hunted round for Bill but Bill was also in baulk. Control had packed him
up-country somewhere,” said Sam, avoiding Smiley’s eye.

“On a wild goose chase,” Smiley murmured. “But he came back.”

Here Sam tipped a sharp, quizzical glance in Smiley’s direction, but he added
nothing on the subject of Bill Haydon’s journey.

“The whole place seemed dead. Damn nearly caught the first plane back to
Vientiane.”

“It pretty much was dead,” Smiley confessed, and thought. Except for
Witchcraft.

And Control, said Sam, looked as though he’d had a five-day fever. He was
surrounded by a sea of files, his skin was yellow, and as he talked he kept
breaking off to wipe his forehead with a handkerchief. He scarcely bothered with
the usual fan-dance at all, said Sam. He didn’t congratulate him on three good
years in the field, or make some snide reference to his private life, which was at
that time messy; he simply said he wanted Sam to do weekend duty instead of
Mary Masterman; could Sam swing it?

“ 'Sure I can swing it,’ I said. Tf you want me to do duty officer. I’ll do it.’ He
said he’d give me the rest of the story on Saturday. Meanwhile I must tell no
one. I mustn’t give a hint anywhere in the building, even that he’d asked me this
one thing. He needed someone good to man the switchboard in case there was a
crisis, but it had to be someone from an outstation or someone like me who’d
been away from head office for a long time. And it had to be an old hand.”

So Sam went to Mary Masterman and sold her a hard-luck story about not
being able to get the tenant out of his flat before he went on leave on Monday;
how would it be if he did her duty for her and saved himself the hotel? He took
over at nine on Saturday morning with his toothbrush and six cans of beer in a
briefcase, which still had palm-tree stickers on the side. Geoff Agate was slated
to relieve him on Sunday evening.

Once again Sam dwelt on how dead the place was. Back in the old days,
Saturdays were much like any other day, he said. Most regional sections had a
deskman working weekends, some even had night staff, and when you took a
tour of the building you had the feeling that, warts and all, this was an outfit that
had a lot going. But that Saturday morning the building might have been
evacuated, said Sam; which in a way, from what he heard later, it had been—on
orders from Control. A couple of wranglers toiled on the second floor; the radio
and code rooms were going strong, but those boys worked all the hours anyway.

Otherwise, said Sam, it was the big silence. He sat around waiting for Control to
ring but nothing happened. He fleshed out another hour teasing the janitors,
whom he reckoned the idlest lot of so-and-so’s in the Circus. He checked their
attendance lists and found two typists and one desk officer marked in but absent,
so he put the head janitor, a new boy called Mellows, on report. Finally he went
upstairs to see if Control was in.

“He was sitting all alone, except for MacFadean. No mothers, no you—^just
old Mac peeking around with jasmine tea and sympathy. Too much?”

“No, just go on, please. As much detail as you can remember.”

“So then Control peeled off another veil. Half a veil. Someone was doing a
special job for him, he said. It was of great importance to the service. He kept
saying that: to the service. Not Whitehall or sterling or the price of fish, but us.
Even when it was all over, I must never breathe a word about it. Not even to you.
Or Bill or Bland or anyone.”

“Nor Alleline?”

“He never mentioned Percy once.”

“No,” Smiley agreed. “He scarcely could at the end.”

“I should regard him, for the night, as Director of Operations. I should see
myself as cut-out between Control and whatever was going on in the rest of the
building. If anything came in—a signal, a phone call, however trivial it seemed
—I should wait till the coast was clear, then whip upstairs and hand it to Control.
No one was to know, now or later, that Control was the man behind the gun. In
no case should I phone him or minute him; even the internal lines were taboo.
Truth, George,” said Sam, helping himself to a sandwich.

“Oh, I do believe you,” said Smiley with feeling.

If outgoing telegrams had to be sent, Sam should once more act as Control’s
cut-out. He need not expect much to happen till this evening; even then it was
most unlikely anything would happen. As to the janitors and people like that, as
Control put it, Sam should do his damnedest to act natural and look busy.

The seance over, Sam returned to the duty room, sent out for an evening
paper, opened a can of beer, selected an outside telephone line, and set about
losing his shirt. There was steeplechasing at Kempton, which he hadn’t watched
for years. Early evening, he took another walk around the lines and tested the
alarm pads on the floor of the general registry. Three out of fifteen didn’t work,
and by this time the janitors were really loving him. He cooked himself an egg,
and when he’d eaten it he trotted upstairs to take a pound off old Mac and give
him a beer.

“He’d asked me to put him a quid on some nag with three left feet. I chatted
with him for ten minutes, went back to my post, wrote some letters, watched a

rotten movie on the telly, then turned in. The first call came just as I was getting
to sleep. Eleven-twenty, exactly. The phones didn’t stop ringing for the next ten
hours. I thought the switchboard was going to blow up in my face.”

“Arcadi’s five down,” said a voice over the box.

“Excuse me,” said Sam, with his habitual grin and, leaving Smiley to the
music, slipped upstairs to cope.

Sitting alone, Smiley watched Sam’s brown cigarette slowly burning away in
the ashtray. He waited, Sam didn’t return, and he wondered whether he should
stub it out. Not allowed to smoke on duty, he thought; house rules.

“All done,” said Sam.

The first call came from the Foreign Office resident clerk on the direct line, said
Sam. In the Whitehall stakes, you might say, the Foreign Office won by a curled
lip.

“The Reuters headman in London had just called him with a story of a
shooting in Prague. A British spy had been shot dead by Russian security forces,
there was a hunt out for his accomplices, and was the F.O. interested? The duty
clerk was passing it to us for information. I said it sounded bunkum, and rang off
just as Mike Meakin, of wranglers, came through to say that all hell had broken
out on the Czech air: half of it was coded, but the other half was en clair. He kept
getting garbled accounts of a shooting near Brno. Prague or Brno? I asked. Or
both? Just Brno. I said keep listening, and by then all five buzzers were going.
Just as I was leaving the room, the resident clerk came back on the direct. The
Reuters man had corrected his story, he said: for Prague read Brno. I closed the
door and it was like leaving a wasps’ nest in your drawing-room. Control was
standing at his desk as I came in. He’d heard me coming up the stairs. Has
Alleline put a carpet on those stairs, by the way?”

“No,” said Smiley. He was quite impassive. “George is like a swift,” Ann had
once told Haydon in his hearing. “He cuts down his body temperature till it’s the
same as the environment. Then he doesn’t lose energy adjusting.”

“You know how quick he was when he looked at you. He checked my hands
to see whether I had a telegram for him, and I wished I’d been carrying
something but they were empty. T’m afraid there’s a bit of a panic,’ I said. I gave
him the gist, he looked at his watch; I suppose he was trying to work out what
should have been happening if everything had been plain sailing. I said, 'Can I
have a brief, please?’ He sat down; I couldn’t see him too well—he had that low
green light on his desk. I said again, T’ll need a brief. Do you want me to deny
it? Why don’t I get someone in?’ No answer. Mind you, there wasn’t anyone to
get, but I didn’t know that yet. T must have a brief.’ We could hear footsteps

downstairs and I knew the radio boys were trying to find me. 'Do you want to
come down and handle it yourself?’ I said. I went round to the other side of the
desk, stepping over these files, all open at different places; you’d think he was
compiling an encyclopaedia. Some of them must have been pre-war. He was
sitting like this.”

Sam bunched the fingers of one hand, put the tips to his forehead, and stared
at the desk. His other hand was laid flat, holding Control’s imaginary fob watch.
“Tell MacFadean to get me a cab, then find Smiley.’ 'What about the
operation?’ I asked. I had to wait all night for an answer. 'It’s deniable,’ he says.
'Both men had foreign documents. No one could know they were British at this
stage.’ 'They’re only talking about one man,’ I said. Then I said, 'Smiley’s in
Berlin.’ That’s what I think I said, anyway. So we have another two-minute
silence. 'Anyone will do. It makes no difference.’ I should have been sorry for
him, I suppose, but just then I couldn’t raise much sympathy. I was having to
hold the baby and I didn’t know a damn thing. MacFadean wasn’t around so I
reckoned Control could find his own cab, and by the time I got to the bottom of
the steps I must have looked like Gordon at Khartoum. The duty harridan from
monitoring was waving bulletins at me like flags, a couple of janitors were
yelling at me, the radio boy was clutching a bunch of signals, the phones were
going—not just my own, but half a dozen of the direct lines on the fourth floor. I
went straight to the duty room and switched off all the lines while I tried to get
my bearings. The monitor—what’s that woman’s name, for God’s sake, used to
play bridge with the Dolphin?”

“Purcell. Molly Purcell.”

“That’s the one. Her story was at least straightforward. Prague radio was
promising an emergency bulletin in half an hour’s time. That was quarter of an
hour ago. The bulletin would concern an act of gross provocation by a Western
power, an infringement of Czechoslovakia’s sovereignty, and an outrage against
freedom-loving people of all nations. Apart from that,” said Sam dryly, “it was
going to be laughs all the way. I rang Bywater Street, of course; then I made a
signal to Berlin telling them to find you and fly you back by yesterday. I gave
Mellows the main phone numbers and sent him off to find an outside line and get
hold of whoever was around of the top brass. Percy was in Scotland for the
weekend and out to dinner. His cook gave Mellows a number; he rang it, spoke
to his host. Percy had just left.”

“I’m sorry,” Smiley interrupted. “Rang Bywater Street, what for?” He was
holding his upper lip between his finger and thumb, pulling it out like a
deformity, while he stared into the middle distance.

“In case you’d come back early from Berlin,” said Sam.

“And had I?”

“ No.”

“So who did you speak to?”

“Ann.”

Smiley said, “Ann’s away just now. Could you remind me how it went, that
conversation?”

“I asked for you and she said you were in Berlin.”

“And that was all?”

“It was a crisis, George,” Sam said, in a warning tone.

“So?”

“I asked her whether by any chance she knew where Bill Haydon was. It was
urgent. I gathered he was on leave but might be around. Somebody once told me
they were cousins.” He added: “Besides, he’s a friend of the family, I
understood.”

“Yes. He is. What did she say?”

“Gave me a shirty ‘no’ and rang off. Sorry about that, George. War’s war.”

“How did she sound?” Smiley asked, after letting the aphorism lie between
them for some while.

“I told you: shirty.”

Roy Bland was at Leeds University talent-spotting, said Sam, and not
available.

Between calls, Sam was getting the whole book thrown at him. He might as
well have invaded Cuba. The military were yelling about Czech tank movements
along the Austrian border; the wranglers couldn’t hear themselves think for the
radio traffic round Brno; and as for the Foreign Office, the resident clerk was
having the vapours and yellow fever all in one. “First Lacon, then the Minister
were baying at the doors, and at half past twelve we had the promised Czech
news bulletin, twenty minutes late but none the worse for that. A British spy
named Jim Ellis, travelling on false Czech papers and assisted by Czech counter¬
revolutionaries, had attempted to kidnap an unnamed Czech general in the
forests near Brno and smuggle him over the Austrian border. Ellis had been shot
but they didn’t say killed; other arrests were imminent. I looked Ellis up in the
workname index and found Jim Prideaux. And I thought, just as Control must
have thought. If Jim is shot and has Czech papers, how the hell do they know his
workname, and how do they know he’s British? Then Bill Haydon arrived, white
as a sheet. Picked up the story on the ticker-tape at his club. He turned straight
round and came to the Circus.”

“At what time was that, exactly?” Smiley asked, with a vague frown. “It must
have been rather late.”

Sam looked as if he wished he could make it easier. “One-fifteen,” he said.

“Which is late, isn’t it, for reading club ticker-tapes.”

“Not my world, old boy.”

“Bill’s the Savile, isn’t he?”

“Don’t know,” said Sam doggedly. He drank some coffee. “He was a treat to
watch, that’s all I can tell you. I used to think of him as an erratic sort of devil.
Not that night, believe me. All right, he was shaken. Who wouldn’t be? He
arrived knowing there’d been a God-awful shooting party and that was about all.
But when I told him that it was Jim who’d been shot, he looked at me like a
madman. Thought he was going to go for me. 'Shot. Shot how? Shot dead?’ I
shoved the bulletins into his hand and he tore through them one by one—”

“Wouldn’t he have known already from the ticker-tape?” Smiley asked, in a
small voice. “I thought the news was everywhere by then: Ellis shot. That was
the lead story, wasn’t it?”

“Depends which news bulletin he saw, I suppose,” Sam shrugged it off.
“Anyway, he took over the switchboard and by morning he’d picked up what
few pieces there were and introduced something pretty close to calm. He told the
Foreign Office to sit tight and hold its water; he got hold of Toby Esterhase and
sent him off to pull in a brace of Czech agents, students at the London School of
Economics. Bill had been letting them hatch till then; he was planning to turn
them round and play them back into Czecho. Toby’s lamplighters sandbagged
the pair of them and locked them up in Sarratt. Then Bill rang the Czech head
resident in London and spoke to him like a sergeant major: threatened to strip
him so bare he’d be the laughing-stock of the profession if a hair of Jim
Prideaux’s head was hurt. He invited him to pass that on to his masters. I felt I
was watching a street accident and Bill was the only doctor. He rang a press
contact and told him in strict confidence that Ellis was a Czech mercenary with
an American contract; he could use the story unattributably. It actually made the
late editions. Soon as he could, he slid off to Jim’s rooms to make sure he’d left
nothing around that a journalist might pick on if a journalist were clever enough
to make the connection, Ellis to Prideaux. I guess he did a thorough cleaning-up
job. Dependents, everything.”

“There weren’t any dependents,” Smiley said. “Apart from Bill, I suppose,” he
added, half under his breath.

Sam wound it up: “At eight o’clock Percy Alleline arrived; he’d cadged a
special plane off the Air Force. He was grinning all over. I didn’t think that was
very clever of him, considering Bill’s feelings, but there you are. He wanted to
know why I was doing duty, so I gave him the same story I’d given to Mary
Masterman: no flat. He used my phone to make a date with the Minister, and was

still talking when Roy Bland came in, hopping mad and half plastered, wanting
to know who the hell had been messing on his patch and practically accusing
me. I said, 'Christ, man, what about old Jim? You could pity him while you were
about it,’ but Roy’s a hungry boy and likes the living better than the dead. I gave
him the switchboard with my love, went down to the Savoy for breakfast, and
read the Sundays. The most any of them did was run the Prague radio reports
and a pooh-pooh denial from the Foreign Office.”

Finally Smiley said, “After that you went to the South of France?”

“For two lovely months.”

“Did anyone question you again—about Control, for instance?”

“Not till I got back. You were out on your ear by then; Control was ill in
hospital.” Sam’s voice deepened a little. “He didn’t do anything silly, did he?”

“He just died. What happened?”

“Percy was acting head boy. He called for me and wanted to know why I’d
done duty for Masterman and what communication I’d had with Control. I stuck
to my story and Percy called me a liar.”

“So that’s what they sacked you for: lying?”

“Alcoholism. The janitors got a bit of their own back. They’d counted five
beer cans in the waste-basket in the duty officer’s lair and reported it to the
housekeepers. There’s a standing order: no booze on the premises. In the due
process of time, a disciplinary body found me guilty of setting fire to the
Queen’s dockyards so I joined the bookies. What happened to you?”

“Oh, much the same. I didn’t seem to be able to convince them I wasn’t
involved.”

“Well, if you want anyone’s throat cut,” said Sam as he saw him quietly out
through a side door into a pretty mews, “give me a buzz.” Smiley was sunk in
thought. “And if you ever want a flutter,” Sam went on, “bring along some of
Ann’s smart friends.”

“Sam, listen. Bill was making love to Ann that night. No, listen. You phoned
her, she told you Bill wasn’t there. As soon as she’d rung off, she pushed Bill out
of bed and he turned up at the Circus an hour later knowing that there had been a
shooting in Czecho. If you were giving me the story from the shoulder—on a
postcard—that’s what you’d say?”

“Broadly.”

“But you didn’t tell Ann about Czecho when you phoned her—”

“He stopped at his club on the way to the Circus.”

“If it was open. Very well: then why didn’t he know that Jim Prideaux had
been shot?”

In the daylight, Sam looked briefly old, though the grin had not left his face.

He seemed about to say something, then changed his mind. He seemed angry,
then thwarted, then blank again. “Cheeribye,” he said. “Mind how you go,” and
withdrew to the permanent night-time of his elected trade.
