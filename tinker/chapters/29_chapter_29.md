Waiting that night, alone in bed at the Islay but not yet able to sleep, Smiley
once more took up the file that Lacon had given him in Mendel’s house. It dated
from the late fifties, when the Circus, like other Whitehall departments, was
being pressed by the competition to take a hard look at the loyalty of its staff.
Most of the entries were routine: telephone intercepts, surveillance reports,
endless interviews with dons, friends, and nominated referees. But one document
held Smiley like a magnet; he could not get enough of it. It was a letter, entered
baldly on the index as “Haydon to Fanshawe, February 3, 1937.” More precisely
it was a handwritten letter, from the undergraduate Bill Haydon to his tutor
Fanshawe, a Circus talent-spotter, introducing the young Jim Prideaux as a
suitable candidate for recruitment to British intelligence. It was prefaced by a
wry explication de texte. The Optimates were “an upper-class Christ Church
Club, mainly old Etonian,” wrote the unknown author. Fanshawe (P.R. de T.
Fanshawe, Legion d’Honneur, O.B.E., Personal File so-and-so) was its founder;
Haydon (countless cross-references) was in that year its leading light. The
political complexion of the Optimates, to whom Haydon’s father had also in his
day belonged, was unashamedly conservative. Fanshawe, now long dead, was a
passionate Empire man and “the Optimates were his private selection tank for
The Great Game,” ran the preface. Curiously enough, Smiley dimly remembered
Fanshawe from his own day: a thin eager man with rimless spectacles, a Neville
Chamberlain umbrella, and an unnatural flush to his cheeks as if he were still
teething. Steed-Asprey called him the fairy godfather.

“My dear Fan, I suggest you stir yourself to make a few enquiries about the
young gentleman whose name is appended on the attached fragment of human
skin.” [Inquisitors’ superfluous note: Prideaux] “You probably know Jim—if you
know him at all—as an athleticus of some accomplishment. What you do not
know but ought to is that he is no mean linguist nor yet a total idiot either ...”
[Here followed a biographical summary of surprising accuracy:... Lycee
Lakanal in Paris, put down for Eton, never went there, Jesuit day-school Prague,
two semesters Strasbourg, parents in European banking, small aristo, live apart.

“Hence our Jim’s wide familiarity with parts foreign, and his rather parentless
look, which I find irresistible. By the way: though he is made up of all different
bits of Europe, make no mistake: the completed version is devoutly our own. At
present, he is a bit of a striver and a puzzler, for he has just noticed that there is a

World Beyond the Touchline and that world is me.

“But you must first hear how I met him.

“As you know, it is my habit (and your command) now and then to put on
Arab costume and go down to the bazaars, there to sit among the great unwashed
and give ear to the word of their prophets, that I may in due course better
confound them. The juju man en vogue that evening came from the bosom of
Mother Russia herself: one Academician Khlebnikov, presently attached to the
Soviet Embassy in London, a jolly, rather infectious little fellow, who managed
some quite witty things among the usual nonsense. The bazaar in question was a
debating club called the Populars—our rival, dear Fan, and well known to you
from other forays I have occasionally made. After the sermon a wildly
proletarian coffee was served, to the accompaniment of a dreadfully democratic
bun, and I noticed this large fellow sitting alone at the back of the room,
apparently too shy to mingle. His face was familiar from the cricket field; it
turns out we both played in some silly scratch team without exchanging a word.

I don’t quite know how to describe him. He has it. Fan. I am serious now.”

Here the handwriting, till now ill-at-ease, spread out as the writer got into his
stride:

“He has that heavy quiet that commands. Hard-headed, quite literally. One of
those shrewd quiet ones that lead the team without anyone noticing. Fan, you
know how hard it is for me to act. You have to remind me all the time,
intellectually remind me, that unless I sample life’s dangers I shall never know
its mysteries. But Jim acts from instinct... he is functional. . . He’s my other
half; between us we’d make one marvellous man, except that neither of us can
sing. And, Fan, you know that feeling when you just have to go out and find
someone new or the world will die on you?”

The writing steadied again.

“ 'Yavas Lagloo,’ says I, which I understand is Russian for meet me in the
woodshed or something similar, and he says 'Oh, hullo,’ which I think he would
have said to the Archangel Gabriel if he’d happened to be passing.

“ 'What is your dilemma?’ says I.

“ 'I haven’t got one,’ says he, after about an hour’s thought.

“ 'Then what are you doing here? If you haven’t a dilemma, how did you get
in?’

“So he gives a big placid grin and we saunter over to the great Khlebnikov,
shake his tiny paw for a while, then toddle back to my rooms. Where we drink.
And drink. And, Fan, he drank everything in sight. Or perhaps I did, I forget.

And come the dawn, do you know what we did? I will tell you. Fan. We walked
solemnly down to the Parks, I sit on a bench with a stop-watch, and big Jim gets

into his running kit and lopes twenty circuits. Twenty. I was quite exhausted.

“We can come to you any time; he asks nothing better than to be in my
company or that of my wicked, divine friends. In short, he has appointed me his
Mephistopheles and I am vastly tickled by the compliment. By the by, he is
virgin, about eight feet tall, and built by the same firm that did Stonehenge. Do
not be alarmed.”

The file died again. Sitting up, Smiley turned the yellowed pages impatiently,
looking for stronger meat. The tutors of both men aver (twenty years later) that it
is inconceivable that the relationship between the two was “more than purely
friendly” ... Haydon’s evidence was never called ... Jim’s tutor speaks of him
as “intellectually omnivorous after long starvation”—dismisses any suggestion
that he was “pink.” The confrontation, which takes place at Sarratt, begins with
long apologies, particularly in view of Jim’s superb war record. Jim’s answers
breathe a pleasing straightforwardness after the extravagance of Haydon’s letter.
One representative of the competition present, but his voice is seldom heard. No,
Jim never again met Khlebnikov or anyone representing himself as his emissary
... No, he never spoke to him but on that one occasion. No, he had no other
contact with Communists or Russians at that time; he could not remember the
name of a single member of the Populars ...

Q: (Alleline) Shouldn’t think that keeps you awake, does it?

A: As a matter of fact, no. (Laughter)

Yes, he had been a member of the Populars just as he had been a member of
his college drama club, the philatelic society, the modern language society, the
Union and the historical society, the ethical society and the Rudolf Steiner study
group ... It was a way of getting to hear interesting lectures, and of meeting
people, particularly the second. No, he had never distributed left-wing literature,
though he did for a while take Soviet Weekly ... No, he had never paid dues to
any political party, at Oxford or later; as a matter of fact, he had never even used
his vote ... One reason why he joined so many clubs at Oxford was that after a
messy education abroad he had no natural English contemporaries from school.

By now the inquisitors are one and all on Jim’s side; everyone is on the same
side against the competition and its bureaucratic meddling.

Q: (Alleline) As a matter of interest, since you were overseas so much, do
you mind telling us where you learned your off-drive? (Laughter)

A: Oh, I had an uncle, actually, with a place outside Paris. He was cricket
mad. Had a net and all the equipment. When I went there for holidays, he

bowled at me non-stop.

[Inquisitors’ note: Comte Henri de Sainte-Yvonne, dec. 1942, P.F. AF64-
7.] End of interview. Competition representative would like to call
Haydon as a witness but Haydon is abroad and not available. Fixture
postponed sine die ...

Smiley was nearly asleep as he read the last entry on the file, tossed in
haphazard long after Jim’s formal clearance had come through from the
competition. It was a cutting from an Oxford newspaper of the day giving a
review of Haydon’s one-man exhibition in June, 1938, headed “Real or Surreal?
An Oxford Eye.”

Having torn the exhibition to shreds, the critic ended on this gleeful note: “We
understand that the distinguished Mr. James Prideaux took time off from his
cricket in order to help hang the canvases. He would have done better, in our
opinion, to remain in the Banbury Road. However, since his role of Dobbin to
the arts was the only heartfelt thing about the whole occasion, perhaps we had
better not sneer too loud ...”

He dozed, his mind a controlled clutter of doubts, suspicions, and certainties.
He thought of Ann, and in his tiredness cherished her profoundly, longing to
protect her frailty with his own. Like a young man, he whispered her name aloud
and imagined her beautiful face bowing over him in the half-light, while Mrs.
Pope Graham yelled prohibition through the keyhole. He thought of Tarr and
Irina, and pondered uselessly on love and loyalty; he thought of Jim Prideaux
and what tomorrow held. He was aware of a modest sense of approaching
conquest. He had been driven a long way; he had sailed backwards and
forwards. Tomorrow, if he was lucky, he might spot land: a peaceful little desert
island, for instance. Somewhere Karla had never heard of. Just for himself and
Ann. He fell asleep.
