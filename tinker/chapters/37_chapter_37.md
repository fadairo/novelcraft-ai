There are moments that are made up of too much stuff for them to be lived at the
time they occur. For Guillam and all those present, this was one. Smiley’s
continued distraction and Haydon’s indifference; his frequent cautious glances
from the window; Polyakov’s predictable fit of indignation, his demands to be
treated as became a member of the Diplomatic Corps—demands that Guillam
from his place on the sofa tersely threatened to meet; the flustered arrival of
Alleline and Bland; more protestations and the pilgrimage upstairs, where
Smiley played the tapes; the long glum silence that followed their return to the
drawing-room; the arrival of Lacon and finally of Esterhase and Fawn; Millie
McCraig’s silent ministrations with the teapot: all these events and cameos
unrolled with a theatrical unreality that, much like the trip to Ascot an age
before, was intensified by the unreality of the hour of day. It was also true that
these incidents, which included at an early point the physical constraint of
Polyakov—and a stream of Russian abuse directed at Fawn for hitting him,
heaven knows where, despite Mendel’s vigilance—were like a silly subplot
against Smiley’s only purpose in convening the assembly: to persuade Alleline
that Haydon offered Smiley’s one chance to treat with Karla, and to save, in
humanitarian if not professional terms, whatever was left of the networks that
Haydon had betrayed. Smiley was not empowered to conduct these transactions,
nor did he seem to want to; perhaps he reckoned that between them Esterhase
and Bland and Alleline were better placed to know what agents were still
theoretically in being. In any event he soon took himself upstairs, where Guillam
heard him once more restlessly padding from one room to the other as he
continued his vigil from the windows.

So while Alleline and his lieutenants withdrew with Polyakov to the dining¬
room to conduct their business alone, the rest of them sat in silence in the
drawing-room, either looking at Haydon or deliberately away from him. He
seemed unaware that they were there. Ghin in hand, he sat apart from them in a
corner, watched over by Fawn, and he looked rather bored. The conference
ended, they all trooped out of the dining-room and Alleline announced to Lacon,
who insisted on not being present at the discussions, that an appointment had
been made three days hence at this address, by which time “the Golonel will
have had a chance to consult his superiors.” Lacon nodded. It might have been a
board meeting.

The departures were even stranger than the arrivals. Between Esterhase and

Polyakov in particular, there was a curiously poignant farewell. Esterhase, who
would always rather have been a gentleman than a spy, seemed determined to
make a gallant occasion of it, and offered his hand, which Polyakov struck
petulantly aside. Esterhase looked round forlornly for Smiley, perhaps in the
hope of ingratiating himself further with him, then shrugged and flung an arm
across Bland’s broad shoulder. Soon afterwards they left together. They didn’t
say goodbye to anybody, but Bland looked dreadfully shaken and Esterhase
seemed to be consoling him, though his own future at that moment could hardly
have struck him as rosy. Soon afterwards a radio cab arrived for Polyakov and
he, too, left without a nod to anyone. By now, the conversation had died entirely;
without the Russian present, the show became wretchedly parochial. Haydon
remained in his familiar bored pose, still watched by Fawn and Mendel, and
stared at in mute embarrassment by Lacon and Alleline. More telephone calls
were made, mainly for cars. At some point Smiley reappeared from upstairs and
mentioned Tarr. Alleline phoned the Circus and dictated one telegram to Paris
saying that he could return to England with honour, whatever that meant; and a
second to Mackelvore saying that Tarr was an acceptable person, which again
seemed to Guillam a matter of opinion.

Finally, to the general relief, a windowless van arrived from the Nursery, and
two men got out whom Guillam had never seen before, one tall and limping, the
other doughy and fair-haired. With a shudder Guillam realised they were
inquisitors. Fawn fetched Haydon’s coat from the hall, went through the pockets,
and respectfully helped him into it. At this point, Smiley gently interposed
himself and insisted that Haydon’s walk from the front door to the van should
take place without the hall light on, and that the escort should be large. Guillam,
Fawn, even Alleline, were pressed into service, and finally, with Haydon at its
centre, the whole motley group shuffled through the garden to the van.

“It’s simply a precaution,” Smiley insisted. No one was disposed to argue with
him. Haydon climbed in, and the inquisitors followed, locking the grille from
inside. As the doors closed, Haydon lifted one hand in an amiable, if dismissive,
gesture directed at Alleline.

So it was only afterwards that separate things came back to Guillam and
single people came forward for his recollection: the unqualified hatred, for
instance, which Polyakov directed against everyone present, from poor little
Millie McGraig upwards, and which actually distorted him; his mouth curved in
a savage, uncontrollable sneer, he turned white and trembled, but not from fear
and not from anger. It was just plain hatred, of the sort that Guillam could not
visit on Haydon, but then Haydon was of his own kind.

For Alleline, in the moment of his defeat, Guillam discovered a sneaking

admiration: Alleline at least had shown a certain bearing. But later Guillam was
not so sure whether Percy realised, on that first presentation of the facts, quite
what the facts were: after all, he was still Chief, and Haydon was still his lago.

But the strangest thing to Guillam, the insight that he took away with him and
thought over much more deeply than was commonly his policy, was that despite
his banked-up anger at the moment of breaking into the room, it required an act
of will on his own part—and quite a violent one, at that—to regard Bill Haydon
with much other than affection. Perhaps, as Bill would say, he had finally grown
up. Best of all, on the same evening he climbed the steps to his flat and heard the
familiar notes of Camilla’s flute echoing in the well. And if Camilla that night
lost something of her mystery, at least by morning he had succeeded in freeing
her from the toils of double-cross to which he had latterly consigned her.

In other ways also, over the next few days, his life took on a brighter look.
Percy Alleline had been dispatched on indefinite leave; Smiley had been asked
to come back for a while and help sweep up what was left. For Guillam himself
there was talk of being rescued from Brixton. It was not till much, much later
that he learned that there had been a final act; and he put a name and a purpose
to that familiar shadow which had followed Smiley through the night streets of
Kensington.
