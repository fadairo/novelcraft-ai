Recalling all this in the seclusion of his first-class compartment, Smiley had the
curious sensation of watching Haydon through the wrong end of a telescope. He
had eaten very little since last night, but the bar had been open for most of the
journey.

Leaving King’s Cross, he had had a wistful notion of liking Haydon and
respecting him: Bill was a man, after all, who had had something to say and had
said it. But his mental system rejected this convenient simplification. The more
he puzzled over Haydon’s rambling account of himself, the more conscious he
was of the contradictions. He tried at first to see Haydon in the romantic
newspaper terms of a thirties intellectual, for whom Moscow was the natural
Mecca. “Moscow was Bill’s discipline,” he told himself. “He needed the
symmetry of an historical and economic solution.” This struck him as too sparse,
so he added more of the man whom he was trying to like: “Bill was a romantic
and a snob. He wanted to join an elitist vanguard and lead the masses out of
darkness.” Then he remembered the half-finished canvases in the girl’s drawing¬
room in Kentish Town: cramped, over-worked, and condemned. He remembered
also the ghost of Bill’s authoritarian father—Ann had called him simply the
Monster—and he imagined Bill’s Marxism making up for his inadequacy as an
artist and for his loveless childhood. Later, of course, it hardly mattered if the
doctrine wore thin. Bill was set on the road and Karla would know how to keep
him there. Treason is very much a matter of habit, Smiley decided, seeing Bill
again stretched out on the floor in Bywater Street, while Ann played him music
on the gramophone.

Bill had loved it, too. Smiley didn’t doubt that for a moment. Standing at the
middle of a secret stage, playing world against world, hero and playwright in
one: oh. Bill had loved that, all right.

Smiley shrugged it all aside, distrustful as ever of the standard shapes of
human motive. He settled instead for a picture of one of those wooden Russian
dolls that open up, revealing one person inside the other, and another inside him.
Of all men living, only Karla had seen the last little doll inside Bill Haydon.
When was Bill recruited, and how? Was his right-wing stand at Oxford a pose,
or was it paradoxically the state of sin from which Karla summoned him to
grace?

Ask Karla: pity I didn’t.

Ask Jim: I never shall.

Over the flat East Anglian landscape as it slid slowly by, the unyielding face
of Karla replaced Bill Haydon’s crooked death mask. “But you had this one
price: Ann. The last illusion of the illusionless man. He reckoned that if I were
known to be Ann’s lover around the place you wouldn’t see me very straight
when it came to other things.”

Illusion? Was that really Karla’s name for love? And Bill’s?

“Here,” said the guard very loudly, and perhaps for the second time. “Come
on with it, you’re for Grimsby, aren’t you?”

“No, no—Immingham.” Then he remembered Mendel’s instructions and
clambered onto the platform.

There was no cab in sight, so, having enquired at the ticket office, he made his
way across the empty forecourt and stood beside a green sign marked “Queue.”
He had hoped she might collect him, but perhaps she hadn’t received his wire.

Ah well: the post office at Christmas: who could blame them? He wondered how
she would take the news about Bill; till, remembering her frightened face on the
cliffs in Cornwall, he realised that by then Bill was already dead for her. She had
sensed the coldness of his touch, and somehow guessed what lay behind it.

Illusion? He repeated to himself. Illusionless?

It was bitterly cold. He hoped very much that her wretched lover had found
her somewhere warm to live.

He wished he had brought her fur boots from the cupboard under the stairs.

He remembered the copy of Grimmelshausen, still uncollected at Martindale’s
club.

Then he saw her: her disreputable car shunting towards him down the lane
marked “Buses Only” and Ann at the wheel staring the wrong way. Saw her get
out, leaving the indicator winking, and walk into the station to enquire: tall and
puckish, extraordinarily beautiful, essentially another man’s woman.

For the rest of that term, Jim Prideaux behaved in the eyes of Roach much as his
mother had behaved when his father went away. He spent a lot of time on little
things, like fixing up the lighting for the school play and mending the soccer nets
with string, and in French he took enormous pains over small inaccuracies. But
big things, like his walks and solitary golf, he gave up altogether, and in the
evenings stayed in and kept clear of the village. Worst of all was his staring
empty look when Roach caught him unaware, and the way he forgot things in
class, even red marks for merit. Roach had to remind him to hand them in each
week.

To support him. Roach took the job of dimmer man on the lighting. Thus at
rehearsals Jim had to give him a special signal—to Bill and no one else. He was

to raise his arm and drop it to his side when he wanted the footlights to fade.

With time, Jim seemed to respond to treatment, however. His eye grew clearer
and he became alert again, as the shadow of his mother’s death withdrew. By the
night of the play, he was more light-hearted than Roach had ever known him.
“Hey, Jumbo, you silly toad, where’s your mac—can’t you see it’s raining?” he
called out as, tired but triumphant, they trailed back to the main building after
the performance. “His real name is Bill,” he heard him explain to a visiting
parent. “We were new boys together.”

The gun. Bill Roach had finally convinced himself, was, after all, a dream.
