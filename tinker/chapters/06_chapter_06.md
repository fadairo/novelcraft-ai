From the outset of this meeting, Smiley had assumed for the main a Buddha-like
inscrutability from which neither Tarr’s story nor the rare interjections of Lacon
and Guillam could rouse him. He sat leaning back with his short legs bent, head
forward, and plump hands linked across his generous stomach. His hooded eyes
had closed behind the thick lenses. His only fidget was to polish his glasses on
the silk lining of his tie, and when he did this his eyes had a soaked, naked look
that was embarrassing to those who caught him at it. His interjection, however,
and the donnish, inane sound that followed Guillam’s explanation, now acted
like a signal upon the rest of the gathering, bringing a shuffling of chairs and a
clearing of throats.

Lacon was foremost: “George, what are your drinking habits? Gan I get you a
Scotch or anything?” He offered drink solicitously, like aspirin for a headache. “I
forgot to say it earlier,” he explained. “George, a bracer: come. It’s winter, after
all. A nip of something?”

“I’m fine, thank you,” Smiley said.

He would have liked a little coffee from the percolator but somehow he didn’t
feel able to ask. Also he remembered it was terrible.

“Guillam?” Lacon proceeded. No; Guillam also found it impossible to accept
alcohol from Lacon.

He didn’t offer anything to Tarr, who went straight on with his narrative.

Tarr took Irina’s presence calmly, he said. He had worked up his fallback
before he entered the building, and now he went straight into his act. He didn’t
pull a gun or slap his hand over her mouth or any of that tripe, as he put it, but he
said he had come to speak to Boris on a private matter; he was sorry and he was
damn well going to sit there till Boris showed up. In good Australian, as became
an outraged car salesman from down under, he explained that while he didn’t
want to barge into anyone’s business he was damned if he was going to have his
girl and his money stolen in a single night by a lousy Russian who couldn’t pay
for his pleasures. He worked up a lot of outrage but managed to keep his voice
down, and then he waited to see what she did.

And that, said Tarr, was how it all began.

It was eleven-thirty when he made Boris’s room. He left at one-thirty with a
promise of a meeting next night. By then the situation was all the other way:

“We weren’t doing anything improper, mind. Just pen friends—right, Mr.
Smiley?”

For a moment, that bland sneer seemed to lay claim to Smiley’s most precious
secrets.

“Right,” he assented vapidly.

There was nothing exotic about Irina’s presence in Hong Kong and no reason
why Thesinger should have known of it, Tarr explained. Irina was a member of
the delegation in her own right. She was a trained textile buyer: “Come to think
of it, she was a sight better qualified than her old man, if I can call him that. She
was a plain kid, a bit blue-stocking for my taste, but she was young and she had
one hell of a pretty smile when she stopped crying.” Tarr coloured quaintly. “She
was good company,” he insisted, as if arguing against a trend. “When Mr.
Thomas from Adelaide came into her life, she was at the end of the line from
worrying what to do about the demon Boris. She thought I was the Angel
Gabriel. Who could she talk to about her husband who wouldn’t turn the dogs on
him? She’d no chums on the delegation; she’d no one she trusted even back in
Moscow, she said. Nobody who hadn’t been through it would ever know what it
was like trying to keep a ruined relationship going while all the time you’re on
the move.” Smiley was once more in a deep trance. “Hotel after hotel, city after
city, not even allowed to speak to the natives in a natural way or get a smile from
a stranger—that’s how she described her life. She reckoned it was a pretty
miserable state of affairs, Mr. Smiley, and there was a lot of God-thumping and
an empty vodka bottle beside the bed to show for it. Why couldn’t she be like
normal people? she kept saying. Why couldn’t she enjoy the Lord’s sunshine like
the rest of us? She loved sightseeing, she loved foreign kids; why couldn’t she
have a kid of her own? A kid born free, not in captivity. She kept saying that:
bom in captivity, born free. T’m a jolly person, Thomas. I’m a normal, sociable
girl. I like people: why should I deceive them when I like them?’ And then she
said, the trouble was that long ago she had been chosen for work that made her
frozen like an old woman and cut her off from God. So that’s why she’d had a
drink and why she was having a cry. She’d kind of forgotten her husband by
then; she was apologising for having a fling, more.” Again he faltered. “I could
scent it, Mr. Smiley. There was gold in her. I could scent it from the start.
Knowledge is power, they say, sir, and Irina had the power, same as she had the
quality. She was hellbent maybe, but she could still give her all. I can sense
generosity in a woman where I meet it, Mr. Smiley. I have a talent for it. And
this lady was generous. Jesus, how do you describe a hunch? Some people can
smell water under the ground ...”

He seemed to expect some show of sympathy, so Smiley said, “I understand,”
and plucked at the lobe of his ear.

Watching him with a strange dependence in his expression, Tarr kept silent a

stretch longer. “First thing next morning, I cancelled my flight and changed my
hotel,” he said finally.

Abruptly Smiley opened his eyes wide. “What did you tell London?”

“Nothing.”

“Why not?”

“Because he’s a devious fool,” said Guillam.

“Maybe I thought Mr. Guillam would say, 'Gome home, Tarr,”’ he replied,
with a knowing glance at Guillam that was not returned. “You see, long ago
when I was a little boy I made a mistake and walked into a honey trap.”

“He made an ass of himself with a Polish girl,” said Guillam.

“He sensed her generosity, too.”

“I knew Irina was no honey trap, but how could I expect Mr. Guillam to
believe me? No way.”

“Did you tell Thesinger?”

“Hell, no.”

“What reason did you give London for postponing your flight?”

“I was due to fly Thursday. I reckoned no one back home would miss me till
Tuesday. Specially with Boris being a dead duck.”

“He didn’t give a reason and the housekeepers posted him absent without
leave on the Monday,” said Guillam. “He broke every rule in the book. And
some that aren’t. By the middle of that week, even Bill Haydon was beating his
war drums. And I was having to listen,” he added tartly.

However that was, Tarr and Irina met next evening. They met again the
evening after that. The first meeting was in a cafe and it limped. They took a lot
of care not to be seen, because Irina was frightened stiff not just of her husband
but of the security guards attached to the delegation—the gorillas, as Tarr called
them. She refused a drink and she was shaking. The second evening Tarr was
still waiting on her generosity. They took the tram up to Victoria Peak, jammed
between American matrons in white socks and eyeshades. The third he hired a
car and drove her round the New Territories till she suddenly got the heebies
about being so close to the Ghinese border, so they had to run for harbour.
Nevertheless she loved that trip, and often spoke of the tidy beauty of it, the fish
ponds and the paddy fields. Tarr also liked the trip because it proved to both of
them that they weren’t being watched. But Irina had still not unpacked, as he put
it.

“Now I’ll tell you a damn odd thing about this stage of the game. At the start,

I worked Thomas the Aussie to death. I fed her a lot of smoke about a sheep
station outside Adelaide and a big property in the high street with a glass front
and 'Thomas’ in lights. She didn’t believe me. She nodded and fooled around

and waited till I’d said my piece; then she said, 'Yes, Thomas,’ 'No, Thomas,’
and changed the subject.”

On the fourth evening, he drove her into the hills overlooking North Shore,
and Irina told Tarr that she had fallen in love with him and that she was
employed by Moscow Centre, she and her husband both, and that she knew Tarr
was in the trade, too; she could tell by his alertness and the way he listened with
his eyes.

“She’d decided I was an English colonel of intelligence,” said Tarr with no
smile at all. “She was crying one minute and laughing the next, and in my
opinion she was three-quarters of the way to being a basket case. Half, she talked
like a pocket-book loony heroine, half like a nice up-and-down suburban kid.

The English were her favourite people. Gentlemen, she kept saying. I’d brought
her a bottle of vodka and she drank half of it in about fifteen seconds flat.

Hooray for English gentlemen. Boris was the lead and Irina was the backup girl.
It was a his-and-hers act, and one day she’d talk to Percy Alleline and tell him a
great secret all for himself. Boris was on a trawl for Hong Kong businessmen
and had a post-box job on the side for the local Soviet residency. Irina ran
courier, boiled down the microdots, and played radio for him on a high-speed
squirt to beat the listeners. That was how it read on paper, see? The two
nightclubs were rendezvous and fallback for his local connect, in that order. But
all Boris really wanted to do was drink and chase the dancing girls and have
depressions. Or else go for five-hour walks because he couldn’t stand being in
the same room with his wife. All Irina did was wait around crying and getting
plastered, and fancy herself sitting alone at Percy’s fireside, telling him all she
knew. I kept her there talking, up on the hill, sitting in the car. I didn’t move
because I didn’t want to break the spell. We watched the dusk fall on the harbour
and the lovely moon come up there, and the peasants slipping by with their long
poles and kerosene lamps. All we needed was Humphrey Bogart in a tuxedo. I
kept my foot on the vodka bottle and let her talk. I didn’t move a muscle. Fact,
Mr. Smiley. Fact,” he declared, with the defence-lessness of a man longing to be
believed, but Smiley’s eyes were closed and he was deaf to all appeal.

“She just completely let go,” Tarr explained, as if it were suddenly an
accident, a thing he had had no part in. “She told me her whole life story, from
birth to Colonel Thomas; that’s me. Mummy, Daddy, early loves, recruitment,
training, her lousy half-marriage, the lot. How her and Boris were teamed at
training and had been together ever since: one of the great unbreakable
relationships. She told me her real name, her work-name, and the cover names
she’d travelled and transmitted by; then she hauled out her handbag and started
showing me her conjuring set: recessed fountain pen, signal plan folded up

inside; concealed camera—the works. 'Wait till Percy sees that/ I tell her—
playing her along, like. It was production-line stuff, mind, nothing coach-built,
but grade-one material all the same. To round it off, she starts barking the dirt
about the Soviet Hong Kong set-up: legmen, safe houses, letter-boxes, the lot. I
was going crazy trying to remember it all.”

“But you did,” said Guillam shortly.

Yes, Tarr agreed; near on, he did. He knew she hadn’t told him the whole
truth, but he knew truth came hard to a girl who’d been a hood since puberty,
and he reckoned that for a beginner she was doing pretty nice.

“I kind of felt for her,” he said with another flash of that false confessiveness.
“I felt we were on the same wave-length, no messing.”

“Quite so,” said Lacon in a rare interjection. He was very pale, but whether
that was anger or the effect of the grey light of early morning creeping through
the shutters, there was no way to tell.
