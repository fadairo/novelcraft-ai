PART II

15

The Hotel Islay in Sussex Gardens—where, on the day after his visit to Ascot,
George Smiley under the name of Barraclough had set up his operational
headquarters—was a very quiet place, considering its position, and perfectly
suited to his needs. It lay a hundred yards south of Paddington Station, one of a
terrace of elderly mansions cut off from the main avenue by a line of plane trees
and a parking patch. The traffic roared past it all night. But the inside, though it
was a fire-bowl of clashing wallpapers and copper lampshades, was a place of
extraordinary calm. Not only was there nothing going on in the hotel, there was
nothing going on in the world, either, and this impression was strengthened by
Mrs. Pope Graham, the proprietor, a major’s widow with a terribly langorous
voice that imparted a sense of deep fatigue to Mr. Barraclough or anyone else
who sought her hospitality. Inspector Mendel, whose informant she had been for
many years, insisted that her name was plain Graham. The Pope had been added
for grandeur or out of deference to Rome.

“Your father wasn’t a Green Jacket, was he, dear?” she enquired, with a yawn,
as she read Barraclough in the register. Smiley paid her fifty pounds’ advance for
a two-week stay, and she gave him Room 8 because he wanted to work. He
asked for a desk and she gave him a rickety card table; Norman, the boy, brought
it. “It’s Georgian,” she said with a sigh, supervising its delivery. “So you will
love it for me, won’t you, dear? I shouldn’t lend it to you, really; it was the
Major’s.”

To the fifty, Mendel privately had added a further twenty on account, from his
own wallet—“dirty oncers,” as he called them—which he later recovered from
Smiley. “No smell to nothing, is there?” he said.

“You could say so,” Mrs. Pope Graham agreed, demurely stowing the notes
among her nether garments.

“I’ll want every scrap,” Mendel warned, seated in her basement apartment
over a bottle of the one she liked. “Times of entry and exit, contacts, life-style,
and most of all,” he said, lifting an emphatic finger, “most of all—and more
important than you can possibly know, this is—I’ll want suspicious persons
taking an interest or putting questions to your staff under a pretext.” He gave her
his state-of-the-nation look. “Even if they say they’re the Guards Armoured and
Sherlock Holmes rolled into one.”

“There’s only me and Norman,” said Mrs. Pope Graham, indicating a shivery
boy in a black overcoat to which had been stitched a velvet collar of beige. “And

they’ll not get far with Norman—will they, dear; you’re too sensitive.”

“Same with his incoming letters,” said the Inspector. “I’ll want postmarks and
times posted where legible, but no tampering or holding back. Same with his
objects.” He allowed a hush to fall as he eyed the substantial safe that formed
such a feature of the furnishings. “Now and then, he’s going to ask for objects to
be lodged. Mainly they’ll be papers, sometimes books. There’s only one person
allowed to look at those objects apart from him.” He pulled a sudden piratical
grin: “Me. Understand? No one else can even know you’ve got them. And don’t
fiddle with them, or he’ll know because he’s sharp. It’s got to be expert fiddling.
I’m not saying any more,” Mendel concluded. Though he did remark to Smiley,
soon after returning from Somerset, that if twenty quid was all it cost them,
Norman and his protectress were the cheapest baby-sitting service in the
business.

In which boast he was pardonably mistaken, for he could hardly be expected
to know of Jim’s recruitment of the entire car club; or the means by which Jim
was able subsequently to trace the path of Mendel’s wary investigations. Nor
could Mendel, or anyone else, have guessed the state of electric alertness to
which anger, and the strain of waiting, and perhaps a little madness, had
seemingly brought Jim.

Room 8 was on the top floor. Its window looked onto the parapet. Beyond the
parapet lay a side street with a shady bookshop and a travel agency called Wide
World. The hand towel was embroidered “Swan Hotel Marlow.” Lacon stalked
in that evening carrying a fat briefcase containing the first consignment of papers
from his office. To talk, the two men sat side by side on the bed while Smiley
played a transistor wireless to drown the sound of their voices. Lacon took this
mawkishly; he seemed somehow too old for the picnic. Next morning on his way
to work, Lacon reclaimed the papers and returned the books that Smiley had
given him to pad out his briefcase. In this role Lacon was at his worst. His
manner was offended and off-hand; he made it clear he detested the irregularity.
In the cold weather, he seemed to have developed a permanent blush. But Smiley
could not have read the files by day, because they were on call to Laeon’s staff
and their absence would have caused an uproar. Nor did he want to. He knew
better than anyone that he was desperately short of time. Over the next three
days this procedure varied very little. Each evening on his way to take the train
from Paddington, Lacon dropped in his papers, and each night Mrs. Pope
Graham furtively reported to Mendel that the sour gangly one had called again—
the one who looked down his nose at Norman. Each morning, after three hours’
sleep and a disgusting breakfast of undercooked sausage and overcooked tomato

—there was no other menu—Smiley waited for Lacon to arrive, then slipped
gratefully into the cold winter’s day to take his place among his fellow men.

They were extraordinary nights for Smiley, alone up there on the top floor.
Thinking of them afterwards—though his days between were just as fraught, and
on the surface more eventful—he recalled them as a single journey, almost a
single night. “And you’ll do it,” Lacon had piped shamelessly in the garden. “Go
forwards, go backwards?” As Smiley retraced path after path into his own past,
there was no longer any difference between the two: forwards or backwards, it
was the same journey and its destination lay ahead of him. There was nothing in
that room, no object among that whole magpie collection of tattered hotel junk,
that separated him from the rooms of his recollection. He was back on the top
floor of the Circus, in his own plain office with the Oxford prints, just as he had
left it a year ago. Beyond his door lay the low-ceilinged anteroom where
Control’s grey-haired ladies, the mothers, softly typed and answered telephones;
while here in the hotel an undiscovered genius along the corridor night and day
tapped patiently at an old machine. At the anteroom’s far end—in Mrs. Pope
Graham’s world there was a bathroom there, and a warning not to use it—stood
the blank door that led to Control’s sanctuary: an alley of a place, with old steel
cupboards and old red books, a smell of sweet dust and jasmine tea. Behind the
desk Control himself, a carcass of a man by then, with his lank grey forelock and
his smile as warm as a skull.

This mental transposition was so complete in Smiley that when his phone rang
—the extension was an extra, payable in cash—he had to give himself time to
remember where he was. Other sounds had an equally confusing effect on him,
such as the rustle of pigeons on the parapet, the scraping of the television mast in
the wind, and—in rain—the sudden river gurgling in the roof valley. For these
sounds also belonged to his past, and in Cambridge Circus were heard by the
fifth floor only. His ear selected them, no doubt, for that very reason: they were
the background jingle of his past. Once in the early morning, hearing a footfall in
the corridor outside his room, Smiley actually went to the bedroom door
expecting to let in the Circus night coding clerk. He was immersed in Guillam’s
photographs at the time, puzzling out, from far too little information, the likely
Circus procedure under lateralism for handling an incoming telegram from Hong
Kong. But instead of the clerk he found Norman, barefooted in pyjamas.

Confetti was strewn over the carpet and two pairs of shoes stood outside the
opposite door, a man’s and a girl’s, though no one at the Islay—least of all
Norman—would ever clean them.

“Stop prying and go to bed,” said Smiley. And when Norman only stared:

“Oh, do go away, will you? ”—And nearly, but he stopped himself in time, “You

grubby little man.”

“Operation Witchcraft,” read the title on the first volume Lacon had brought to
him that first night. “Policy regarding distribution of Special Product.” The rest
of the cover was obliterated by warning labels and handling instructions,
including one that quaintly advised the accidental finder to “return the file
UNREAD” to the Chief Registrar at the Cabinet Office. “Operation Witchcraft,”
read the second. “Supplementary estimates to the Treasury, special
accommodation in London, special financing arrangements, bounty, etc.”
“Source Merlin,” read the third, bound to the first with pink ribbon. “Customer
Evaluations, cost effectiveness, wider exploitation; see also Secret Annexe.” But
the secret annexe was not attached, and when Smiley asked for it there was a
coldness.

“The Minister keeps it in his personal safe,” Lacon snapped.

“Do you know the combination?”

“Certainly not,” he retorted, now furious.

“What is the title of it?”

“It can be of no possible concern to you. I entirely fail to see why you should
waste your time chasing after this material in the first place. It’s highly secret
and we have done everything humanly possible to keep the readership to the
minimum.”

“Even a secret annexe has to have a title,” said Smiley mildly.

“This has none.”

“Does it give the identity of Merlin?”

“Don’t be ridiculous. The Minister would not want to know, and Alleline
would not want to tell him.”

“What does 'wider exploitation’ mean?”

“I refuse to be interrogated, George. You’re not family any more, you know.
By rights, I should have you specially cleared, as it is.”

“Witchcraft-cleared?”

“Yes.”

“Do we have a list of people who have been cleared in that way?”

It was in the policy file, Lacon retorted, and all but slammed the door on him
before coming back, to the slow chant of “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?”
introduced by an Australian disc-jockey. “The Minister—” He stopped, and
began again. “He doesn’t like devious explanations. He has a saying: he’ll only
believe what can be written on a postcard. He’s very impatient to be given
something he can get his hands on.”

Smiley said, “You won’t forget Prideaux, will you? Just anything you have on

him at all; even scraps are better than nothing.”

With that, Smiley left Lacon to glare awhile, then make a second exit: “You’re
not going fey, are you, George? You realise that Prideaux had most likely never
even heard of Witchcraft before he was shot? I really do fail to see why you
can’t stick with the primary problem instead of rootling around in . . But by
this time he had talked himself out of the room.

Smiley turned to the last of the batch: “Operation Witchcraft, correspondence
with Department.” “Department” being one of Whitehall’s many euphemisms
for the Circus. This volume was conducted in the form of official minutes
between the Minister on the one side, and on the other—recognisable at once by
his laborious schoolboy hand—Percy Alleline, at that time still consigned to the
bottom rungs of Control’s ladder of beings.

A very dull monument, Smiley reflected, surveying these much-handled files,
to such a long and cruel war.
