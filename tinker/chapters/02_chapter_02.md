Unlike Jim Prideaux, Mr. George Smiley was not naturally equipped for
hurrying in the rain, least of all at dead of night. Indeed, he might have been the
final form for which Bill Roach was the prototype. Small, podgy, and at best
middle-aged, he was by appearance one of London’s meek who do not inherit
the earth. His legs were short, his gait anything but agile, his dress costly, ill-
fitting, and extremely wet. His overcoat, which had a hint of widowhood about
it, was of that black loose weave which is designed to retain moisture. Either the
sleeves were too long or his arms were too short, for, as with Roach, when he
wore his mackintosh, the cuffs all but concealed the fingers. For reasons of
vanity he wore no hat, believing rightly that hats made him ridiculous. “Like an
egg-cosy,” his beautiful wife had remarked not long before the last occasion on
which she left him, and her criticism, as so often, had endured. Therefore the
rain had formed in fat, unbanishable drops on the thick lenses of his spectacles,
forcing him alternately to lower or throw back his head as he scuttled along the
pavement that skirted the blackened arcades of Victoria Station. He was
proceeding west, to the sanctuary of Chelsea, where he lived. His step, for
whatever reason, was a fraction uncertain, and if Jim Prideaux had risen out of
the shadows demanding to know whether he had any friends, he would probably
have answered that he preferred to settle for a taxi.

“Roddy’s such a windbag,” he muttered to himself as a fresh deluge dashed
itself against his ample cheeks, then trickled downward to his sodden shirt.

“Why didn’t I just get up and leave?”

Ruefully, Smiley once more rehearsed the reasons for his present misery, and
concluded with a dispassion inseparable from the humble part of his nature that
they were of his own making.

It had been from the start a day of travail. He had risen too late after working
too late the night before, a practice that had crept up on him since retirement last
year. Discovering he had run out of coffee, he queued at the grocer’s till he ran
out of patience also, then haughtily decided to attend to his personal
administration. His bank statement, which had arrived with the morning’s post,
revealed that his wife had drawn the lion’s share of his monthly pension: very
well, he decreed, he would sell something. The response was irrational, for he
was quite decently off and the obscure City bank responsible for his pension paid
it with regularity. Wrapping up an early edition of Grimmelshausen,
nevertheless, a modest treasure from his Oxford days, he solemnly set off for

Heywood Hill’s bookshop in Curzon Street, where he occasionally contracted
friendly bargains with the proprietor. On the way he became even more irritable,
and from a call-box sought an appointment with his solicitor for that afternoon.

“George, how can you be so vulgar? Nobody divorces Ann. Send her flowers
and come to lunch.”

This advice bucked him up and he approached Heywood Hill with a merry
heart only to walk slap into the arms of Roddy Martindale emerging from
Trumper’s after his weekly haircut.

Martindale had no valid claim on Smiley either professionally or socially. He
worked on the fleshy side of the Foreign Office and his job consisted of lunching
visiting dignitaries whom no one else would have entertained in his woodshed.
He was a floating bachelor with a grey mane and that nimbleness which only fat
men have. He affected buttonholes and pale suits, and he pretended on the
flimsiest grounds to an intimate familiarity with the large back rooms of
Whitehall. Some years ago, before it was disbanded, he had adorned a Whitehall
working party to co-ordinate intelligence. In the war, having a certain
mathematical facility, he had also haunted the fringes of the secret world; and
once, as he never tired of telling, he had worked with John Landsbury on a
Circus coding operation of transient delicacy. But the war, as Smiley sometimes
had to remind himself, was thirty years ago.

“Hullo, Roddy,” said Smiley. “Nice to see you.”

Martindale spoke in a confiding upper-class bellow of the sort that, on foreign
holidays, had more than once caused Smiley to sign out of his hotel and run for
cover.

“My dear boy, if it isn’t the maestro himself! They told me you were locked
up with the monks in Saint Gallen or somewhere, poring over manuscripts!
Confess to me at once. I want to know all you’ve been doing, every little bit. Are
you well? Do you love England still? How’s the delicious Ann?” His restless
gaze flicked up and down the street before lighting on the wrapped volume of
Grimmelshausen under Smiley’s arm. “Pound to a penny that’s a present for her.
They tell me you spoil her outrageously.” His voice dropped to a mountainous
murmur: “I say, you’re not back on the beat, are you? Don’t tell me it’s all cover,
George, cover?” His sharp tongue explored the moist edges of his little mouth,
then, like a snake, vanished between its folds.

So, fool that he was, Smiley bought his escape by agreeing to dine that same
evening at a club in Manchester Square to which they both belonged but which
Smiley avoided like the pest, not least because Roddy Martindale was a member.
When evening came, he was still full of luncheon at the White Tower, where his
solicitor, a very self-indulgent man, had decided that only a great meal would

recover George from his doldrums. Martindale, by a different route, had reached
the same conclusion, and for four long hours over food Smiley did not want they
had bandied names as if they were forgotten footballers. Jebedee, who was
Smiley’s old tutor: “Such a loss to us, bless him,” murmured Martindale, who so
far as Smiley knew had never clapped eyes on Jebedee. “And what a talent for
the game, eh? One of the real greats, I always say.” Then Fielding, the French
mediaevalist from Cambridge: “Oh, but what a lovely sense of humour. Sharp
mind, sharp!” Then Sparke from the School of Oriental Languages, and lastly
Steed-Asprey, who had founded that very club in order to escape from bores like
Roddy Martindale.

“I knew his poor brother, you know. Half the mind and twice the brawn, bless
him. Brain went all the other way.”

And Smiley through a fog of drink had listened to this nonsense, saying “yes”
and “no” and “what a pity” and “no, they never found him,” and once, to his
abiding shame, “oh, come, you flatter me,” till with lugubrious inevitability
Martindale came to more recent things—the change of power and Smiley’s
withdrawal from the service.

Predictably, he started with the last days of Control: “Your old boss, George,
bless him, the only one who ever kept his name a secret. Not from you, of
course, he never had any secrets from you, George, did he? Close as thieves,
Smiley and Control were, so they say, right to the end.”

“They’re very complimentary.”

“Don’t flirt, George; I’m an old trooper, you forget. You and Control were just
like that.” Briefly the plump hands made a token marriage. “That’s why you
were thrown out—don’t deceive me, that’s why Bill Haydon got your job. That’s
why he’s Percy Alleline’s cup-bearer and you’re not.”

“If you say so, Roddy.”

“I do. I say more than that. Far more.”

As Martindale drew closer, Smiley caught the odour of one of Trumper’s most
sensitive creations.

“I say something else: Control never died at all. He’s been seen.” With a
fluttering gesture he silenced Smiley’s protests. “Let me finish. Willy
Andrewartha walked straight into him in Jo’burg airport, in the waiting-room.
Not a ghost. Flesh. Willy was at the bar buying a soda for the heat; you haven’t
seen Willy recently but he’s a balloon. He turned round, and there was Control
beside him dressed up like a ghastly Boer. The moment he saw Willy he bolted.
How’s that? So now we know. Control never died at all. He was driven out by
Percy Alleline and his three-piece band, so he went to ground in South Africa,

bless him. Well, you can’t blame him, can you? You can’t blame a man for
wanting a drop of peace in the evening of his life. I can’t.”

The monstrosity of this, reaching Smiley through a thickening wall of spiritual
exhaustion, left him momentarily speechless.

“That’s ridiculous! That’s the most idiotic story I ever heard! Control is dead.
He died of a heart attack after a long illness. Besides, he hated South Africa. He
hated everywhere except Surrey, the Circus, and Lords Cricket Ground. Really,
Roddy, you mustn’t tell stories like that.” He might have added: I buried him
myself at a hateful crematorium in the East End, last Christmas Eve, alone. The
parson had a speech impediment.

“Willy Andrewartha was always the most God-awful liar,” Martindale
reflected, quite unruffled. “I said the same to him myself: The sheerest
nonsense, Willy; you should be ashamed of yourself.’ ” And straight on, as if
never by thought or word had he subscribed to that silly view: “It was the Czech
scandal that put the final nail into Control’s coffin, I suppose. That poor fellow
who was shot in the back and got himself into the newspapers, the one who was
so thick with Bill Haydon always, so we hear. Ellis, we’re to call him, and we
still do, don’t we, even if we know his real name as well as we know our own.”

Shrewdly Martindale waited for Smiley to cap this, but Smiley had no
intention of capping anything, so Martindale tried a third tack.

“Somehow I can never quite believe in Percy Alleline as Chief, can you? Is it
age, George, or is it just my natural cynicism? Do tell me, you’re so good at
people. I suppose power sits poorly on those we’ve grown up with. Is that a
clue? There are so few who can carry it off for me these days and poor Percy’s
such an obvious person, I always think, specially after that little serpent. Control.
That heavy good fellowship—how can one take him seriously? One has only to
think of him in the old days lolling in the bar of the Travellers’, sucking away on
that log pipe of his and buying drinks for the moguls; well, really, one does like
one’s perfidy to be subtle, don’t you agree? Or don’t you care as long as it’s
successful? What’s his knack, George, what’s his secret recipe?” He was
speaking most intently, leaning forward, his eyes greedy and excited. Only food
could otherwise move him so deeply. “Living off the wits of his subordinates—
well, maybe that’s leadership these days.”

“Really, Roddy, I can’t help you,” said Smiley weakly. “I never knew Percy as
a force, you see. Only as a—” He lost the word.

“A striver,” Martindale suggested, eyes glistening. “With his sights on
Control’s purple, day and night. Now he’s wearing it and the mob loves him. So
who’s his strong left arm, George? Who’s earning him his reputation?
Wonderfully well he’s doing, we hear it from all sides. Little reading rooms at

the Admiralty, little committees popping up with funny names, red carpet for
Percy wherever he goes in the Whitehall corridors, junior ministers receiving
special words of congratulation from on high, people one’s never heard of
getting grand medals for nothing. I’ve seen it all before, you know.”

“Roddy, I can’t help you,” Smiley insisted, making to get up. “You’re out of
my depth, truly.” But Martindale was physically restraining him, holding him at
the table with one damp hand while he talked still faster.

“So who’s the cleverboots? Not Percy, that’s for sure. And don’t tell me the
Americans have started trusting us again, either.” The grip tightened. “Dashing
Bill Haydon, our latter-day Lawrence of Arabia, bless him; there you are—it’s
Bill, your old rival.” Martindale’s tongue poked out its head again, reconnoitred
and withdrew, leaving a thin smile like a trail. “I’m told that you and Bill shared
everything once upon a time,” he said. “Still, he never was orthodox, was he?
Genius never is.”

“Anything further you require, Mr. Smiley?” the waiter asked.

“Then it’s Bland: the shop-soiled white hope, the redbrick don.” Still he would
not release him. “And if those two aren’t providing the speed, it’s someone in
retirement, isn’t it? I mean someone pretending to be in retirement, don’t I? And
if Control’s dead, who is there left? Apart from you.”

They were putting on their coats. The porters had gone home; they had to
fetch them for themselves from the empty brown racks.

“Roy Bland’s not redbrick,” Smiley said loudly. “He was at Saint Antony’s
College, Oxford, if you want to know.”

Heaven help me, it was the best I could do, thought Smiley.

“Don’t be silly, dear,” Martindale snapped. Smiley had bored him: he looked
sulky and cheated; distressing downward folds had formed on the lower contours
of his cheeks. “Of course Saint Antony’s is redbrick; it makes no difference
there’s a little bit of sandstone in the same street, even if he was your protege. I
expect he’s Bill Haydon’s now—don’t tip him, it’s my party, not yours. Father to
them all. Bill is—always was. Draws them like bees. Well, he has the glamour,
hasn’t he; not like some of us. Star quality I call it, one of the few. I’m told the
women literally bow down before him, if that’s what women do.”

“Good night, Roddy.”

“Love to Ann, mind.”

“I won’t forget.”

“Well, don’t.”

And now it was pouring with rain, Smiley was soaked to the skin, and God as
a punishment had removed all taxis from the face of London.
