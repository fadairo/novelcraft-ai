Guillam drove languidly but fast. Smells of autumn filled the car, a full moon
was shining, strands of mist hung over open fields, and the cold was irresistible.
Smiley wondered how old Guillam was and guessed forty, but in that light he
could have been an undergraduate sculling on the river; he moved the gear lever
with a long flowing movement as if he were passing it through water. In any
case, Smiley reflected irritably, the car was far too young, for Guillam. They had
raced through Runnymede and begun the run up Egham Hill. They had been
driving for twenty minutes and Smiley had asked a dozen questions and received
no answer worth a penny, and now a nagging fear was waking in him that he
refused to name.

“Tm surprised they didn’t throw you out with the rest of us,” he said, not very
pleasantly, as he hauled the skirts of his coat more tightly round him. “You had
all the qualifications: good at your work, loyal, discreet.”

“They put me in charge of scalp-hunters.”

“Oh, my Lord,” said Smiley with a shudder, and, pulling up his collar round
his ample chins, he abandoned himself to that memory in place of others more
disturbing: Brixton, and the grim flint schoolhouse that served the scalp-hunters
as their headquarters. The scalp-hunters’ official name was Travel. They had
been formed by Gontrol on Bill Haydon’s suggestion in the pioneer days of the
cold war, when murder and kidnapping and crash blackmail were common
currency, and their first commandant was Haydon’s nominee. They were a small
outfit, about a dozen men, and they were there to handle the hit-and-run jobs that
were too dirty or too risky for the residents abroad. Good intelligence work,
Gontrol had always preached, was gradual and rested on a kind of gentleness.
The scalp-hunters were the exception to his own rule. They weren’t gradual and
they weren’t gentle either, thus reflecting Haydon’s temperament rather than
GontroTs. And they worked solo, which was why they were stabled out of sight
behind a flint wall with broken glass and barbed wire on the top.

“I asked whether 'lateralism’ was a word to you.”

“It most certainly is not.”

“It’s the Tn’ doctrine. We used to go up and down. Now we go along.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?”

“In your day, the Gircus ran itself by regions. Africa, satellites, Russia, Ghina,
South East Asia, you name it: each region was commanded by its own juju man;
Gontrol sat in heaven and held the strings. Remember?”

“It strikes a distant chord.”

“Well, today everything operational is under one hat. It’s called London
Station. Regions are out, lateralism is in. Bill Haydon’s Commander London
Station, Roy Bland’s his number two, Toby Esterhase runs between them like a
poodle. They’re a service within a service. They share their own secrets and
don’t mix with the proles. It makes us more secure.”

“It sounds a very good idea,” said Smiley, studiously ignoring the innuendo.

As the memories once more began seething upward into his conscious mind,
an extraordinary feeling passed over him: that he was living the day twice, first
with Martindale in the club, now again with Guillam in a dream. They passed a
plantation of young pine trees. The moonlight lay in strips between them.

Smiley began, “Is there any word of—” Then he asked, in a more tentative
tone, “What’s the news of Ellis?”

“In quarantine,” said Guillam tersely.

“Oh, I’m sure. Of course. I don’t mean to pry. Merely, can he get around and
so on? He did recover; he can walk? Backs can be terribly tricky, I understand.”

“The word says he manages pretty well. How’s Ann, I didn’t ask.”

“Fine. Just fine.”

It was pitch dark inside the car. They had turned off the road and were passing
over gravel. Black walls of foliage rose to either side, lights appeared, then a
high porch, and the steepled outline of a rambling house lifted above the
treetops. The rain had stopped, but as Smiley stepped into the fresh air he heard
all round him the restless ticking of wet leaves.

Yes, he thought, it was raining when I came here before, when the name Jim
Ellis was headline news.

They had washed and, in the lofty cloakroom, inspected Eacon’s climbing kit
mawkishly dumped on the Sheraton chest of drawers. Now they sat in a half¬
circle facing one empty chair. It was the ugliest house for miles around and
Eacon had picked it up for a song. “A Berkshire Gamelot,” he had once called it,
explaining it away to Smiley, “built by a teetotal millionaire.” The drawing-room
was a great hall with stained-glass windows twenty feet high and a pine gallery
over the entrance. Smiley counted off the familiar things: an upright piano
littered with musical scores, old portraits of clerics in gowns, a wad of printed
invitations. He looked for the Gambridge University oar and found it slung over
the fireplace. The same fire was burning, too mean for the enormous grate. An
air of need prevailing over wealth.

“Are you enjoying retirement, George?” Eacon asked, as if blurting into the
ear trumpet of a deaf aunt. “You don’t miss the warmth of human contact? I

rather would, I think. One’s work, one’s old buddies.”

He was a string bean of a man, graceless and boyish: church and spy
establishment, said Haydon, the Circus wit. His father was a dignitary of the
Scottish church and his mother something noble. Occasionally the smarter
Sundays wrote about him, calling him “new-style” because he was young. The
skin of his face was clawed from hasty shaving.

“Oh, 1 think 1 manage very well, really, thank you,” said Smiley politely. And
to draw it out: “Yes. Yes, I’m sure I do. And you? All goes well with you?”

“No big changes, no. All very smooth. Charlotte got her scholarship to
Roedean, which was nice.”

“Oh, good.”

“And your wife, she’s in the pink and so on?”

His expressions were also boyish.

“Very bonny, thank you,” said Smiley, trying gallantly to respond in kind.

They were watching the double doors. From far off they heard the jangle of
footsteps on a ceramic floor. Smiley guessed two people, both men. The doors
opened and a tall figure appeared half in silhouette. For the fraction of a
moment, Smiley glimpsed a second man behind him, dark, small, and attentive;
but only the one man stepped into the room before the doors were closed by
unseen hands.

“Lock us in, please,” Lacon called, and they heard the snap of the key. “You
know Smiley, don’t you?”

“Yes, I think I do,” said the figure as he began the long walk towards them out
of the far gloom. “I think he once gave me a job, didn’t you, Mr. Smiley?”

His voice was as soft as a southerner’s drawl, but there was no mistaking the
colonial accent. “Tarr, sir. Ricki Tarr from Penang.”

A fragment of firelight illuminated one side of the stark smile and made a
hollow of one eye. “The lawyer’s boy, remember? Come on, Mr. Smiley, you
changed my first nappies.”

And then, absurdly, they were all four standing, and Guillam and Lacon
looked on like godparents while Tarr shook Smiley’s hand once, then again, then
once more for the photographs.

“How are you, Mr. Smiley? It’s real nice to see you, sir.”

Relinquishing Smiley’s hand at last, he swung away in the direction of his
appointed chair, while Smiley thought. Yes, with Ricki Tarr it could have
happened. With Tarr, anything could have happened. My God, he thought; two
hours ago I was telling myself I would take refuge in the past. He felt thirsty, and
supposed it was fear.

Ten? Twelve years ago? It was not his night for understanding time. Among
Smiley’s jobs in those days was the vetting of recruits: no one taken on without
his nod, no one trained without his signature on the schedule. The cold war was
running high, scalp-hunters were in demand, the Circus’s residencies abroad had
been ordered by Haydon to look out for likely material. Steve Mackelvore from
Djakarta came up with Tarr. Mackelvore was an old pro with cover as a shipping
agent, and he had found Tarr angry drunk, kicking round the docks looking for a
girl called Rose, who had walked out on him.

According to Tarr’s story, he was mixed up with a bunch of Belgians running
guns between the islands and up-coast. He disliked Belgians and he was bored
with gunrunning and he was angry because they’d stolen Rose. Mackelvore
reckoned he would respond to discipline and was young enough to train for the
type of mailfist operation that the scalp-hunters undertook from behind the walls
of their glum Brixton schoolhouse. After the usual searches, Tarr was forwarded
to Singapore for a second look, then to the Nursery at Sarratt for a third. At that
point Smiley came into the act as moderator at a succession of interviews, some
hostile. Sarratt Nursery was the training compound, but it had space for other
uses.

Tarr’s father was an Australian solicitor living in Penang, it seemed. The
mother was a small-time actress from Bradford who came East with a British
drama group before the war. The father, Smiley recalled, had an evangelical
streak and preached in local gospel halls. The mother had a small criminal record
in England, but Tarr’s father either didn’t know or didn’t care. When the war
came, the couple evacuated to Singapore for the sake of their young son. A few
months later, Singapore fell and Ricki Tarr began his education in Changi jail
under Japanese supervision. In Changi the father preached God’s charity to
everyone in sight, and if the Japs hadn’t persecuted him his fellow prisoners
would have done the job for them. With Liberation, the three of them went back
to Penang. Ricki tried to read for the law but more often broke it, and the father
turned some rough preachers loose on him to beat the sin out of his soul. Tarr
flew the coop to Borneo. At eighteen he was a fully paid-up gunrunner playing
all seven ends against the middle around the Indonesian islands, and that was
how Mackelvore stumbled on him.

By the time he had graduated from the Nursery, the Malayan emergency had
broken. Tarr was played back into gunrunning. Almost the first people he
bumped into were his old Belgian friends. They were too busy supplying guns to
the Communists to bother where he had been, and they were shorthanded. Tarr
ran a few shipments for them in order to blow their contacts, then one night got
them drunk, shot four of them, including Rose, and set fire to their boat. He hung

around Malaya and did a couple more jobs before being called back to Brixton
and refitted for special operations in Kenya—or, in less sophisticated language,
hunting Mau Mau for bounty.

After Kenya, Smiley pretty much lost sight of him, but a couple of incidents
stuck in his memory because they might have become scandals and Control had
to be informed. In 1964, Tarr was sent to Brazil to make a crash offer of a bribe
to an armaments minister known to be in deep water. Tarr was too rough; the
minister panicked and told the press. Tarr had Dutch cover and no one was wiser
except Netherlands intelligence, who were furious. In Spain a year later, acting
on a tip-off supplied by Bill Haydon, Tarr blackmailed—or burned, as the scalp-
hunters would say—a Polish diplomat who had lost his heart to a dancer. The
first yield was good; Tarr won a commendation and a bonus. But when he went
back for a second helping the Pole wrote a confession to his ambassador and
threw himself, with or without encouragement, from a high window.

In Brixton, they used to call him accident-prone. Guillam, by the expression
on his immature but aging face, as they sat in their half-circle round the meagre
fire, called him a lot worse than that.

“Well, I guess Td better make my pitch,” Tarr said pleasantly as he settled his
easy body into the chair.
