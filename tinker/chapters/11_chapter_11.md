Peter Guillam was a chivalrous fellow whose conscious loyalties were
determined by his affections. The others had been made over long ago to the
Circus. His father, a French businessman, had spied for a Circus reseau in the
war while his mother, an Englishwoman, did mysterious things with codes. Until
eight years ago, under the cover of a shipping clerk, Guillam himself had run his
own agents in French North Africa, which was considered a murderous
assignment. He was blown, his agents were hanged, and he entered the long
middle age of the grounded pro. He did hackwork in London, sometimes for
Smiley, ran a few home-based operations, including a network of girlfriends who
were not, as the jargon has it, inter-conscious, and when Alleline’s crowd took
over he was shoved out to grass in Brixton—he supposed because he had the
wrong connections, among them Smiley. That, resolutely, was how until last
Friday he would have told the story of his life. Of his relationship with Smiley
he would have dwelt principally upon the end.

Guillam was living mainly in London docks in those days, where he was
putting together low-grade Marine networks from whatever odd Polish, Russian,
and Chinese seamen he and a bunch of talent-spotters occasionally managed to
get their hands on. Betweenwhiles he sat in a small room on the first floor of the
Circus and consoled a pretty secretary called Mary, and he was quite happy
except that no one in authority would answer his minutes. When he used the
phone, he got “engaged” or no answer. He had heard vaguely there was trouble,
but there was always trouble. It was common knowledge, for instance, that
Alleline and Control had locked horns, but they had been doing little else for
years. He also knew, like everyone else, that a big operation had aborted in
Czechoslovakia, that the Foreign Office and the Defence Ministry had jointly
blown a gasket, and that Jim Prideaux—head of scalp-hunters, the oldest Czecho
hand, and Bill Haydon’s lifelong stringer—had been shot up and put in the bag.
Hence, he assumed, the loud silence and the glum faces. Hence also Bill
Haydon’s manic anger, of which the news spread like a nervous thrill through all
the building: like God’s wrath, said Mary, who loved a full-scale passion. Later
he heard the catastrophe called Testify. Testify, Haydon told him much later, was
the most incompetent bloody operation ever launched by an old man for his
dying glory, and Jim Prideaux was the price of it. Bits made the newspapers,
there were parliamentary questions, and even rumours, never officially
confirmed, that British troops in Germany had been put on full alert.

Eventually, by sauntering in and out of other people’s offices, he began to
realise what everyone else had realised some weeks before. The Circus wasn’t
just silent, it was frozen. Nothing was coming in, nothing was going out; not at
the level on which Guillam moved, anyhow. Inside the building, people in
authority had gone to earth, and when pay day came round there were no buff
envelopes in the pigeon-holes because, according to Mary, the housekeepers had
not received the usual monthly authority to issue them. Now and then somebody
would say they had seen Alleline leaving his club and he looked furious. Or
Control getting into his car and he looked sunny. Or that Bill Haydon had
resigned, on the grounds that he had been overruled or undercut, but Bill was
always resigning. This time, said the rumour, the grounds were somewhat
different, however: Haydon was furious that the Circus would not pay the Czech
price for Jim Prideaux’s repatriation; it was said to be too high in agents, or
prestige. And that Bill had broken out in one of his fits of chauvinism and
declared that any price was fair to get one loyal Englishman home: give them
everything, only get Jim back.

Then, one evening, Smiley peered round Guillam’s door and suggested a
drink. Mary didn’t realise who he was and just said “Hullo” in her stylish
classless drawl. As they walked out of the Circus side by side, Smiley wished the
janitors good night with unusual terseness, and in the pub in Wardour Street he
said, “I’ve been sacked,” and that was all.

From the pub they went to a wine bar off Charing Cross, a cellar with music
playing and no one there. “Did they give any reason?” Guillam enquired. “Or is
it just because you’ve lost your figure?”

It was the word “reason” that Smiley fixed on. He was by then politely but
thoroughly drunk, but reason, as they walked unsteadily along the Thames
embankment, reason got through to him.

“Reason as logic, or reason as motive?” he demanded, sounding less like
himself than Bill Haydon, whose pre-war, Oxford Union style of polemic
seemed in those days to be in everybody’s ears. “Or reason as a way of life?”
They sat on a bench. “They don’t have to give me reasons. I can write my own
damn reasons. And that is not the same,” he insisted as Guillam guided him
carefully into a cab, gave the driver the money and the address, “that is not the
same as the half-baked tolerance that comes from no longer caring.”

“Amen,” said Guillam, fully realising as he watched the cab pull into the
distance that by the rules of the Circus their friendship, such as it was, had that
minute ended. Next day Guillam learned that more heads had rolled and that
Percy Alleline was to stand in as night watchman with the title of acting chief,
and that Bill Haydon, to everyone’s astonishment, but most likely out of

persisting anger with Control, would serve under him; or, as the wise ones said,
over him.

By Christmas, Control was dead. “They’ll get you next,” said Mary, who saw
these events as a second storming of the Winter Palace, and she wept when
Guillam departed for the siberias of Brixton, ironically to fill Jim Prideaux’s slot.

Climbing the four steps to the Circus that wet Monday afternoon, his mind
bright with the prospect of felony, Guillam passed these events in review and
decided that today was the beginning of the road back.

He had spent the previous night at his spacious flat in Eaton Place in the
company of Camilla, a music student with a long body and a sad, beautiful face.
Though she was not more than twenty, her black hair was streaked with grey, as
if from a shock she never talked about. As another effect, perhaps, of the same
undescribed trauma, she ate no meat, wore no leather, and drank nothing
alcoholic; only in love, it seemed to Guillam, was she free of these mysterious
restraints.

He had spent the morning alone in his extremely dingy room in Brixton
photographing Circus documents, having first drawn a subminiature camera
from his own operational stores, a thing he did quite often to keep his hand in.
“Daylight or electric?” the storeman asked, and they had a friendly discussion
about film grain. He told his secretary he didn’t want to be disturbed, closed his
door, and set to work according to Smiley’s precise instructions. The windows
were high in the wall. Even sitting, he could see only the sky and the tip of the
new school up the road.

He began with works of reference from his personal safe. Smiley had given
him priorities. First the staff directory, on issue to senior officers only, which
supplied the home addresses, telephone numbers, names, and worknames of all
home-based Circus personnel. Second, the handbook on staff duties, including
the fold-in diagram of the Circus’s reorganisation under Alleline. At its centre
lay Bill Haydon’s London Station, like a giant spider in its own web. “After the
Prideaux fiasco,” Bill had reputedly fumed, “we’ll have no more damned private
armies, no more left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing.” Alleline,
he noticed, was billed twice: once as Chief, once as Director Special Sources.
According to rumour, it was those sources that kept the Circus in business.
Nothing else, in Guillam’s view, could account for the Circus’s inertia at
working level and the esteem it enjoyed in Whitehall. To these documents, at
Smiley’s insistence, he added the scalp-hunters’ revised charter, in the form of an
Alleline letter beginning “Dear Guillam,” and setting out in detail the diminution
of his powers. In several cases, the winner was Toby Esterhase, head of Acton

lamplighters, the one outstation that had actually grown fatter under lateralism.

Next he moved to his desk and photographed, also on Smiley’s instruction, a
handful of routine circulars that might be useful as background reading. These
included a belly-ache from Admin., on the state of safe houses in the London
area (“Kindly treat them as if they were your own ”), and another about the
misuse of unlisted Circus telephones for private calls. Lastly a very rude
personal letter from documents warning him “for the last time of asking” that his
workname driving licence was out of date, and that unless he took the trouble to
renew it “his name would be forwarded to the housekeepers for appropriate
disciplinary action.”

He put away the camera and returned to his safe. On the bottom shelf lay a
stack of lamplighter reports issued over Toby Esterhase’s signature and stamped
with the code word “Hatchet.” These supplied the names and cover jobs of the
two or three hundred identified Soviet intelligence officers operating in London
under legal or semi-legal cover: trade, Tass, Aeroflot, Radio Moscow, consular,
and diplomatic. Where appropriate, they also gave the dates of lamplighter
investigations and names of branch lines, which is jargon for contacts thrown up
in the course of surveillance and not necessarily run to earth. The reports came
in a main annual volume and monthly supplements. He consulted the main
volume first, then the supplements. At eleven-twenty he locked his safe, rang
London Station on the direct line, and asked for Lauder Strickland, of Banking
Section.

“Lauder, this is Peter from Brixton; how’s trade?”

“Yes, Peter, what can we do for you?”

Brisk and blank. We of London Station have more important friends, said the
tone.

It was a question of washing some dirty money, Guiham explained, to finance
a ploy against a French diplomatic courier who seemed to be for sale. In his
meekest voice, he wondered whether Lauder could possibly find the time for
them to meet and discuss it. Was the project cleared with London Station, Lauder
demanded. No, but Guiham had already sent the papers to Bill by shuttle. Lauder
Strickland came down a peg. Guiham pressed his cause: “There are one or two
tricky aspects, Lauder; I think we need your sort of brain.”

Lauder said he could spare him half an hour.

On his way to the West End, he dropped his films at the meagre premises of a
chemist called Eark, in the Gharing Gross Road. Eark, if it was he, was a very fat
man with tremendous fists. The shop was empty.

“Mr. Lampton’s films, to be developed,” said Guiham. Lark took the package
to the back room, and when he returned he said “Ah done” in a gravel voice.

then blew out a lot of air at once, as if he were smoking, which he wasn’t. He
saw Guillam to the door and closed it behind him with a clatter. Where on God’s
earth does George find them, Guillam wondered. He had bought some throat
pastilles. Every move must be accountable, Smiley had warned him: assume that
the Gircus has the dogs on you twenty-four hours a day. So what’s new about
that, Guillam thought; Toby Esterhase would put the dogs on his own mother if it
bought him a pat on the back from Alleline.

From Gharing Gross he walked up to Ghez Victor for lunch with his head
man, Gy Vanhofer, and a thug calling himself Eorimer, who claimed to be
sharing his mistress with the East German ambassador in Stockholm. Eorimer
said the girl was ready to play ball but she needed British citizenship and a lot of
money on delivery of the first take. She would do anything, he said: spike the
ambassador’s mail, bug his rooms, or “put broken glass in his bath,” which was
supposed to be a joke. Guillam reckoned Eorimer was lying, and he was inclined
to wonder whether Vanhofer was too, but he was wise enough to realise that he
was in no state to say which way anyone was leaning just then. He liked Ghez
Victor but had no recollection of what he ate, and now as he entered the lobby of
the Gircus he knew the reason was excitement.

“Hullo, Bryant.”

“Nice to see you, sir. Take a seat, sir, please, just for a moment, sir, thank
you,” said Bryant, all in one breath, and Guillam perched on the wooden settle
thinking of dentists and Gamilla. She was a recent and somewhat mercurial
acquisition; it was a while since things had moved quite so fast for him. They
met at a party and she talked about truth, alone in a corner over a carrot juice.
Guillam, taking a long chance, said he wasn’t too good at ethics, so why didn’t
they just go to bed together? She considered for a while, gravely; then fetched
her coat. She’d been hanging around ever since, cooking nut rissoles and playing
the flute.

The lobby looked dingier than ever. Three old lifts, a wooden barrier, a poster
for Mazawattee tea, Bryant’s glass-fronted sentry box with a “Scenes of
England” calendar, and a line of mossy telephones.

“Mr. Strickland is expecting you, sir,” said Bryant as he emerged, and in slow
motion stamped a pink chit with the time of day: “14:55, P. Bryant, Janitor.” The
grille of the centre lift rattled like a bunch of dry sticks.

“Time you oiled this thing, isn’t it?” Guillam called as he waited for the
mechanism to mesh.

“We keep asking,” said Bryant, embarking on a favourite lament. “They never
do a thing about it. You can ask till you’re blue in the face. How’s the family,
sir?”

“Fine,” said Guillam, who had none.

“That’s right,” said Bryant. Looking down, Guillam saw the creamy head
vanish between his feet. Mary called him strawberry and vanilla, he
remembered: red face, white hair, and mushy.

In the lift he examined his pass. “Permit to enter L.S.,” ran the headline.
“Purpose of visit: Banking Section. This document to be handed back on
leaving.” And a space, marked “host’s signature,” blank.

“Well met, Peter. Greetings. You’re a trifle late, I think, but never mind.”

Lauder was waiting at the barrier—all five foot nothing of him, white collared
and secretly on tiptoe—to be visited. In Gontrol’s day this floor had been a
thoroughfare of busy people. Today a barrier closed the entrance and a rat-faced
janitor scrutinised his pass.

“Good God, how long have you had that monster?” Guillam asked, slowing
down before a shiny new coffee machine. A couple of girls, filling beakers,
glanced round and said “Hullo, Lauder,” looking at Guillam. The tall one
reminded him of Gamilla: the same slow-burning eyes, censuring male
insufficiency.

“Ah, but you’ve no notion how many man-hours it saves!” Lauder cried at
once. “Fantastic. Quite fantastic,” and all but knocked over Bill Haydon in his
enthusiasm.

He was emerging from his room, an hexagonal pepper pot overlooking New
Gompton Street and the Gharing Gross Road. He was moving in the same
direction as they were but at about half a mile an hour, which for Bill indoors
was full throttle. Outdoors was a different matter; Guillam had seen that, too—
on training games at Sarratt, and once on a night drop in Greece. Outdoors he
was swift and eager; his keen face, in this clammy corridor shadowed and
withdrawn, seemed in the free air to be fashioned by the outlandish places where
he had served. There was no end to them: no operational theatre, in Guillam’s
admiring eyes, that did not bear the Haydon imprint somewhere. Over and again
in his own career, he had made the same eerie encounter with Bill’s exotic
progress. A year or two back, still working on Marine intelligence and having as
one of his targets the assembly of a team of coast-watchers for the Ghinese ports
of Wenchow and Amoy, Guillam discovered to his amazement that there were
actually Ghinese stay-behind agents living in those very towns, recruited by Bill
Haydon in the course of some forgotten wartime exploit, rigged out with cached
radios and equipment, with whom contact might be made. Another time, raking
through war records of Gircus strong-arm men, more out of nostalgia for the
period than present professional optimism, Guillam stumbled twice on Haydon’s
workname in as many minutes: in 1941 he was running French fishing smacks

out of the Helford Estuary; in the same year, with Jim Prideaux as his stringer, he
was laying down courier lines across southern Europe from the Balkans to
Madrid. To Guillam, Haydon was of that unrepeatable, fading Circus generation,
to which his parents and George Smiley also belonged—exclusive and, in
Haydon’s case, blue-blooded—which had lived a dozen leisured lives to his own
hasty one, and still, thirty years later, gave the Circus its dying flavour of
adventure.

Seeing them both, Haydon stood rock-still. It was a month since Guillam had
spoken to him; he had probably been away on unexplained business. Now,
against the light of his own open doorway, he looked strangely black and tall. He
was carrying something—Guillam could not make out what it was—a magazine,
a file, or a report; his room, split by his own shadow, was an undergraduate
mayhem, monkish and chaotic. Reports, flimsies, and dossiers lay heaped
everywhere; on the wall a baize noticeboard jammed with postcards and press
cuttings; beside it, askew and unframed, one of Bill’s old paintings, a rounded
abstract in the hard flat colours of the desert.

“Hullo, Bill,” said Guillam.

Leaving his door open—a breach of housekeeper regulations—Haydon fell in
ahead of them, still without a word. He was dressed with his customary
dottiness. The leather patches of his jacket were stitched on like diamonds, not
squares, which from behind gave him a harlequin look. His spectacles were
jammed up into his hair like goggles. For a moment they followed him
uncertainly, till, without warning, he suddenly turned himself round, all of him at
once like a statue being slowly swivelled on its plinth, and fixed his gaze on
Guillam. Then he grinned, so that his crescent eyebrows went straight up like a
clown’s, and his face became handsome and absurdly young.

“What the hell are you doing here, you pariah?” he enquired pleasantly.

Taking the question seriously, Lauder started to explain about the Frenchman
and the dirty money.

“Well, mind you lock up the spoons,” said Bill, talking straight through him.
“Those bloody scalp-hunters will steal the gold out of your teeth. Lock up the
girls, too,” he added as an afterthought, his eyes still on Guillam, “if they’ll let
you. Since when did scalp-hunters wash their own money? That’s our job.”

“Lauder’s doing the washing. We’re just spending the stuff.”

“Papers to me,” Haydon said to Strickland, with sudden curtness. “I’m not
crossing any more bloody wires.”

“They’re already routed to you,” said Guillam. “They’re probably in your in-
tray now.”

A last nod sent them on ahead, so that Guillam felt Haydon’s pale blue gaze

boring into his back all the way to the next dark turning.

“Fantastic fellow,” Lauder declared, as if Guillam had never met him.

“London Station could not be in better hands. Incredible ability. Incredible
record. Brilliant.”

Whereas you, thought Guillam savagely, are brilliant by association. With
Bill, with the coffee machine, with banks. His meditations were interrupted by
Roy Bland’s caustic cockney voice, issuing from a doorway ahead of them.

“Hey, Lauder, hold on a minute: have you seen Bloody Bill anywhere? He’s
wanted urgently.”

Followed at once by Toby Esterhase’s faithful mid-European echo from the
same direction: “Immediately, Lauder; actually, we have put out an alert for
him.”

They had entered the last cramped corridor. Lauder was perhaps three paces
on and was already composing his answer to this question as Guillam arrived at
the open doorway and looked in. Bland was sprawled massively at his desk. He
had thrown off his jacket and was clutching a paper. Arcs of sweat ringed his
armpits. Tiny Toby Esterhase was stooped over him like a headwaiter, a stiff-
backed miniature ambassador with silvery hair and a crisp unfriendly jaw, and he
had stretched out one hand towards the paper as if to recommend a speciality.
They had evidently been reading the same document when Bland caught sight of
Lauder Strickland passing.

“Indeed I have seen Bill Haydon,” said Lauder, who had a trick of rephrasing
questions to make them sound more seemly. “I suspect Bill is on his way to you
this moment. He’s a way back there down the corridor; we were having a brief
word about a couple of things.”

Bland’s gaze moved slowly to Guillam and settled there; its chilly appraisal
was uncomfortably reminiscent of Haydon’s. “Hullo, Pete,” he said. At this.

Tiny Toby straightened up and turned his eyes also directly towards Guillam;
brown and quiet like a pointer’s.

“Hi,” said Guillam, “what’s the joke?”

Their greeting was not merely frosty; it was downright hostile. Guillam had
lived cheek by jowl with Toby Esterhase for three months on a very dodgy
operation in Switzerland and Toby had never smiled once, so his stare came as
no surprise. But Roy Bland was one of Smiley’s discoveries, a warmhearted and
impulsive fellow for that world, red-haired and burly, an intellectual primitive
whose idea of a good evening was talking Wittgenstein in the pubs round
Kentish Town. He’d spent ten years as a Party hack, plodding the academic
circuit in Eastern Europe, and now, like Guillam, he was grounded, which was
even something of a bond. His usual style was a big grin, a slap on the shoulder.

and a blast of last night’s beer; but not today.

“No joke, Peter, old boy,” said Roy, mustering a belated smile. “Just surprised
to see you, that’s all. We’re used to having this floor to ourselves.”

“Here’s Bill,” said Lauder, very pleased to have his prognostication so
promptly confirmed. In a strip of light, as he entered it, Guillam noticed the
queer colour of Haydon’s cheeks. A blushing red, daubed high on the bones, but
deep, made up of tiny broken veins. It gave him, thought Guillam in his
heightened state of nervousness, a slightly Dorian Gray look.

His meeting with Lauder Strickland lasted an hour and twenty minutes; Guillam
spun it out that long, and throughout it his mind went back to Bland and
Esterhase and he wondered what the hell was eating them.

“Well, I suppose I’d better go and clear all this with the Dolphin,” he said at
last. “We all know how she is about Swiss banks.” The housekeepers lived two
doors down from Banking. “I’ll leave this here,” he added and tossed the pass on
to Lauder’s desk.

Diana Dolphin’s room smelt of fresh deodorant; her chain-mail handbag lay
on the safe beside a copy of the Financial Times. She was one of those groomed
Gircus brides whom no one ever marries. Yes, he said wearily, the operational
papers were already on submission to London Station. Yes, he understood that
freewheeling with dirty money was a thing of the past.

“Then we shall look into it and let you know,” she announced, which meant
she would go and ask Phil Porteous, who sat next door.

“I’ll tell Lauder, then,” said Guillam, and left.

Move, he thought.

In the men’s room he waited thirty seconds at the basins, watching the door in
the mirror and listening. A curious quiet had descended over the whole floor.
Gome on, he thought, you’re getting old; move. He crossed the corridor, stepped
boldly into the duty officers’ room, closed the door with a slam, and looked
round. He reckoned he had ten minutes, and he reckoned that a slammed door
made less noise in that silence than a door surreptitiously closed. Move.

He had brought the camera but the light was awful. The net-curtained window
looked onto a courtyard full of blackened pipes. He couldn’t have risked a
brighter bulb even if he’d had one with him, so he used his memory. Nothing
much seemed to have changed since the takeover. In the daytime the place was
used as a restroom for girls with the vapours, and to judge by the smell of cheap
scent it still was. Along one wall lay the imitation-leather divan, which at night
made into a rotten bed; beside it the first-aid chest with the red cross peeling off
the front, and a clapped-out television. The steel cupboard stood in its same

place between the switchboard and the locked telephones, and he made a beeline
for it. It was an old cupboard and he could have opened it with a tin opener. He
had brought his picks and a couple of light alloy tools. Then he remembered that
the combination used to be 31-22-11 and he tried it, four anti, three clock, two
anti, clockwise till she springs. The dial was so jaded it knew the way. When he
opened the door, dust rolled out of the bottom in a cloud, crawled a distance,
then slowly lifted towards the dark window. At the same moment, he heard what
sounded like a single note played on a flute: it came from a car, most likely,
braking in the street outside; or the wheel of a file trolley squeaking on linoleum.
But for that moment it was one of those long, mournful notes which made up
Camilla’s practice scales. She played exactly when she felt like it. At midnight,
in the early morning, or whenever. She didn’t give a damn about the neighbours;
she seemed quite nerveless altogether. He remembered her that first evening:
“Which is your side of the bed? Where shall I put my clothes?” He prided
himself on his delicate touch in such things, but Camilla had no use for it;
technique was already a compromise, a compromise with reality—she would say
an escape from it. All right, so get me out of this lot.

The duty logbooks were on the top shelf, in bound volumes with the dates
pasted on the spines. They looked like family account books. He took down the
volume for April and studied the list of names on the inside cover, wondering
whether anyone could see him from the dupe-room across the courtyard, and if
they could, would they care? He began working through the entries, searching
for the night of the tenth and eleventh, when the signals traffic between London
Station and Tarr was supposed to have taken place. Hong Kong was eight hours
ahead, Smiley had pointed out: Tarr’s telegram and London’s first answer had
both happened out of hours.

From the corridor came a sudden swell of voices, and for a second he even
fancied he could pick out Alleline’s growling border brogue lifted in humourless
banter, but fancies were two a penny just now. He had a cover story and a part of
him believed it already. If he was caught, the whole of him would believe it; and
if the Sarratt inquisitors sweated him, he had a fallback—he never travelled
without one. All the same, he was terrified. The voices died, and the ghost of
Percy Alleline with them. Sweat was running over his ribs. A girl tripped past
humming a tune from Hair. If Bill hears you, he’ll murder you, he thought; if
there’s one thing that sends Bill spare it’s humming. “What are you doing here,
you pariah?”

Then, to his fleeting amusement, he actually heard Bill’s infuriated roar,
echoing from God knows what distance: “Stop that moaning. Who is the fool?”

Move. Once you stop, you never start again: there is a special stage-fright that

can make you dry up and walk away, that burns your fingers when you touch the
goods and turns your stomach to water. Move. He put back the April volume and
drew four others at random: February, June, September, and October. He flicked
through them fast, looking for comparisons, returned them to the shelf, and
dropped into a crouch. He wished to God the dust would settle; there seemed to
be no end to it. Why didn’t someone complain? Always the same when a lot of
people use one place: no one’s responsible, no one gives a hoot. He was looking
for the night janitors’ attendance lists. He found them on the bottom shelf,
jammed in with the tea-bags and the condensed milk: sheafs of them in
envelope-type folders. The janitors filled them in and brought them to you twice
in your twelve-hour tour of duty: at midnight and again at 6 A.M. You vouched
for their correctness—God knows how, since the night staff were scattered all
over the building—signed them off, kept the third copy, and chucked it in the
cupboard, no one knew why. That was the procedure before the Flood, and it
seemed to be the procedure now.

Dust and tea-bags on one shelf, he thought. How long since anyone made tea?

Once again he fixed his sights on April lOth-llth. His shirt was clinging to
his ribs. What’s happened to me? Ghrist, I’m over the hill. He turned forward
and back, forward again, twice, three times, then closed the cupboard on the lot.
He waited, listened, took a last worried look at the dust, then stepped boldly
across the corridor, back to the safety of the men’s room. On the way the clatter
hit him: coding machines, the ringing of the telephones, a girFs voice calling
“Where’s that damn float—I had it in my hand,” and that mysterious piping
again, but no longer like Gamilla’s in the small hours. Next time I’ll get her to do
the job, he thought savagely; without compromise, face to face, the way life
should be.

In the men’s room he found Spike Kaspar and Nick de Silsky standing at the
hand basins and murmuring at each other into the mirror: legmen for Haydon’s
Soviet networks, they’d been around for years, known simply as “the Russians.”
Seeing Guillam, they at once stopped talking.

“Hullo, you two. Ghrist, you really are inseparable.”

They were blond and squat and they looked more like Russians than the real
ones. He waited till they’d gone, rinsed the dust off his fingers, then drifted back
to Lauder Strickland’s room.

“Lord save us, that Dolphin does talk,” he said carelessly.

“Very able officer. Nearest thing to indispensable we have around here.
Extremely competent, you can take my word for it,” said Lauder. He looked
closely at his watch before he signed the chit, then led Guillam back to the lifts.
Toby Esterhase was at the barrier, talking to an unfriendly young janitor.

“You are going back to Brixton, Peter?” His tone was casual, his expression as
usual impenetrable.

“Why?”

“I have a car outside, actually. I thought maybe I could run you. We have
some business out that way.”

Run you: Tiny Toby spoke no known language perfectly, but he spoke them
all. In Switzerland, Guillam had heard his French and it had a German accent;
his German had a Slav accent and his English was full of stray flaws and stops
and false vowel sounds.

“It’s all right, Tobe, I think I’ll just go home. Night.”

“Straight home? I would run you, that’s all.”

“Thanks, I’ve got shopping to do. All those bloody godchildren.”

“Sure,” said Toby as if he hadn’t any, and stuck in his little granite jaw in
disappointment.

What the hell does he want, Guillam thought. Tiny Toby and Big Roy, both:
why were they giving me the eye? Was it something they were reading or
something they ate?

Out in the street he sauntered down the Gharing Gross Road peering at the
windows of the bookshops while his other mind checked both sides of the
pavement. It had turned much colder, a wind was getting up, and there was a
promise to people’s faces as they bustled by. He felt elated. Till now he had been
living too much in the past, he decided. Time to get my eye in again. In
Zwemmer’s he examined a coffee-table book called Musical Instruments Down
the Ages and remembered that Gamilla had a late lesson with Dr. Sand, her flute-
teacher. He walked back as far as Foyle’s, glancing down bus queues as he went.
Think of it as abroad, Smiley had said. Remembering the duty room and Roy
Bland’s fishy stare, Guillam had no difficulty. And Bill, too: was Haydon party
to their same suspicion? No. Bill was his own category, Guillam decided, unable
to resist a surge of loyalty to Haydon. Bill would share nothing that was not his
own in the first place. Set beside Bill, those other two were pygmies.

In Soho he hailed a cab and asked for Waterloo Station. At Waterloo, from a
reeking phone box, he telephoned a number in Mitcham, Surrey, and spoke to an
Inspector Mendel, formerly of Special Branch, known to both Guillam and
Smiley from other lives. When Mendel came on the line, Guillam asked for
Jenny and heard Mendel tell him tersely that no Jenny lived there. He apologised
and rang off. He dialed the time and feigned a pleasant conversation with the
automatic announcer because there was an old lady outside waiting for him to
finish. By now he should be there, he thought. He rang off and dialed a second
number in Mitcham, this time a call-box at the end of Mendel’s avenue.

“This is Will,” said Guillam.

“And this is Arthur,” said Mendel cheerfully. “How’s Will?” He was a
quirkish, loping tracker of a man, sharp-faced and sharp-eyed, and Guillam had a
very precise picture of him just then, leaning over his policeman’s notebook with
his pencil poised.

“1 want to give you the headlines now in case 1 go under a bus.”

“That’s right. Will,” said Mendel consolingly. “Gan’t be too careful.”

He gave his message slowly, using the scholastic cover they had agreed on as
a last protection against random interception: exams, students, stolen papers.
Each time he paused, he heard nothing but a faint scratching. He imagined
Mendel writing slowly and legibly and not speaking till he had it all down.

“1 got those happy snaps from the chemist, by the by,” said Mendel finally,
when he had checked it all back. “Gome out a treat. Not a miss among them.”

“Thanks. I’m glad.”

But Mendel had already rung off.

I’ll say one thing for moles, thought Guillam: it’s a long dark tunnel all the
way. As he held open the door for the old lady, he noticed the telephone receiver
lying on its cradle, how the sweat crawled over it in drips. He considered his
message to Mendel; he thought again of Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase staring
at him through the doorway; he wondered quite urgently where Smiley was, and
whether he was taking care. He returned to Eaton Place needing Gamilla badly,
and a little afraid of his reasons. Was it really age that was against him suddenly?
Somehow, for the first time in his life, he had sinned against his own notions of
nobility. He had a sense of dirtiness, even of self-disgust.
