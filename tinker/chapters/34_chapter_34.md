It was almost four o’clock on the afternoon of the same day. Safe houses 1 have
known, thought Guillam, looking round the gloomy flat. He could write of them
the way a commercial traveller could write about hotels: from your five-star hall
of mirrors in Belgravia, with Wedgwood pilasters and gilded oak leaves, to this
two-room scalp-hunters’ shakedown in Lexham Gardens, smelling of dust and
drains, with a three-foot fire extinguisher in the pitch-dark hall. Over the
fireplace, cavaliers drinking out of pewter. On the nest of tables, sea-shells for
ashtrays; and in the grey kitchen, anonymous instructions to “Be Sure and Turn
Off the Gas Both Gocks.” He was crossing the hall when the house bell rang,
exactly on time. He lifted the phone and heard Toby’s distorted voice howling in
the earpiece. He pressed the button and heard the clunk of the electric lock
echoing in the stairwell. He opened the front door but left it on the chain till he
was sure Toby was alone.

“How are we?” said Guillam cheerfully, letting him in.

“Fine, actually, Peter,” said Toby, pulling off his coat and gloves.

There was tea on a tray: Guillam had prepared it, two cups. To safe houses
belongs a certain standard of catering. Either you are pretending that you live
there or that you are adept anywhere; or simply that you think of everything. In
the trade, naturalness is an art, Guillam decided. That was something Gamilla
could not appreciate.

“Actually, it’s quite strange weather,” Esterhase announced, as if he had really
been analysing its qualities. Safe-house small-talk was never much better. “One
walks a few steps and is completely exhausted already. So we are expecting a
Pole?” he said, sitting down. “A Pole in the fur trade who you think might run
courier for us.”

“Due here any minute.”

“Do we know him? 1 had my people look up the name but they found no
trace.”

My people, thought Guillam: 1 must remember to use that one. “The Free
Poles made a pass at him a few months back and he ran a mile,” he said. “Then
Karl Stack spotted him round the warehouses and thought he might be useful to
the scalp-hunters.” He shrugged. “1 liked him but what’s the point? We can’t
even keep our own people busy.”

“Peter, you are very generous,” said Esterhase reverently, and Guillam had the
ridiculous feeling he had just tipped him. To his relief, the front doorbell rang

and Fawn took up his place in the doorway.

“Sorry about this, Toby,” Smiley said, a little out of breath from the stairs.
“Peter, where shall I hang my coat?”

Turning him to the wall, Guillam lifted Toby’s unresisting hands and put them
against it, then searched him for a gun, taking his time. Toby had none.

“Did he come alone?” Guillam asked. “Or is there some little friend waiting in
the road?”

“Looked all clear to me,” said Fawn.

Smiley was at the window, gazing down into the street. “Put the light out a
minute, will you?” he said.

“Wait in the hall,” Guillam ordered, and Fawn withdrew, carrying Smiley’s
coat. “Seen something?” he asked Smiley, joining him at the window.

Already the London afternoon had taken on the misty pinks and yellows of
evening. The square was Victorian residential; at the centre, a caged garden,
already dark. “Just a shadow, I suppose,” said Smiley with a grunt, and turned
back to Esterhase. The clock on the mantelpiece chimed four. Fawn must have
wound it up.

“I want to put a thesis to you, Toby. A notion about what’s going on. May I?”

Esterhase didn’t move an eyelash. His little hands rested on the wooden arms
of his chair. He sat quite comfortably, but slightly to attention, toes and heels of
his polished shoes together.

“You don’t have to speak at all. There’s no risk to listening, is there?”

“Maybe.”

“It’s two years ago. Percy Alleline wants Gontrol’s job, but he has no standing
in the Gircus. Gontrol has made sure of that. Gontrol is sick and past his prime
but Percy can’t dislodge him. Remember the time?”

Esterhase gave a neat nod.

“One of those silly seasons,” said Smiley, in his reasonable voice. “There isn’t
enough work outside so we start intriguing around the service, spying on one
another. Percy’s sitting in his room one morning with nothing to do. He has a
paper appointment as Operational Director, but in practice he’s a rubber stamp
between the regional sections and Gontrol, if that. Percy’s door opens and
somebody walks in. We’ll call him Gerald—it’s just a name. 'Percy,’ he says,
T’ve stumbled on a major Russian source. It could be a gold-mine.’ Or perhaps
he doesn’t say anything till they’re outside the building, because Gerald is very
much a fieldman; he doesn’t like to talk with walls and telephones around.
Perhaps they take a walk in the park or a drive in a car. Perhaps they eat a meal
somewhere, and at this stage there isn’t much Percy can do but listen. Percy’s

had very litde experience of the European scene, remember, least of all Czecho
or the Balkans. He cut his teeth in South America and after that he worked the
old possessions: India, the Middle East. He doesn’t know a lot about Russians or
Czechs or what you will; he’s inclined to see red as red and leave it at that.
Unfair?”

Esterhase pursed his lips and frowned a little, as if to say he never discussed a
superior.

“Whereas Gerald is an expert on those things. His operational life has been
spent weaving and ducking round the Eastern markets. Percy’s out of his depth
but keen. Gerald’s on his home ground. This Russian source, says Gerald, could
be the richest the Circus has had for years. Gerald doesn’t want to say too much
but he expects to be getting some trade samples in a day or two, and when he
does, he’d like Percy to run his eye over them just to get a notion of the quality.
They can go into source details later. 'But why me?’ says Percy. 'What’s it all
about?’ So Gerald tells him. 'Percy,’ he says, 'some of us in the regional sections
are worried sick by the level of operational losses. There seems to be a jinx
around. Too much loose talk inside the Circus and out. Too many people being
cut in on distribution. Out in the field, our agents are going to the wall, our
networks are being rolled up or worse, and every new ploy ends up a street
accident. We want you to help us put that right.’ Gerald is not mutinous, and he’s
careful not to suggest that there’s a traitor inside the Circus who’s blowing all the
operations, because you and I know that once talk like that gets around the
machinery grinds to a halt. Anyway the last thing Gerald wants is a witch-hunt.
But he does say that the place is leaking at the joints, and that slovenliness at the
top is leading to failures lower down. All balm to Percy’s ear. He lists the recent
scandals and he’s careful to lean on Alleline’s own Middle East adventure,
which went so wrong and nearly cost Percy his career. Then he makes his
proposal. This is what he says. In my thesis, you understand—it’s just a thesis.”

“Sure, George,” said Toby, and licked his lips.

“Another thesis would be that Alleline was his own Gerald, you see. It just
happens that I don’t believe it; I don’t believe Percy is capable of going out and
buying himself a top Russian spy and manning his own boat from then on. I
think he’d mess it up.”

“Sure,” said Esterhase, with absolute confidence.

“So this, in my thesis, is what Gerald says to Percy next. 'We—that is, myself
and those like-minded souls who are associated with this project—would like
you to act as our father figure, Percy. We’re not political men, we’re operators.
We don’t understand the Whitehall jungle. But you do. You handle the
committees, we’ll handle Merlin. If you act as our cut-out, and protect us from

the rot that’s set in, which means in effect limiting knowledge of the operation to
the absolute minimum, we’ll supply the goods.’ They talk over ways and means
in which this might be done; then Gerald leaves Percy to fret for a bit. A week, a
month, I don’t know. Long enough for Percy to have done his thinking. One day
Gerald produces the first sample. And of course it’s very good. Very, very good.
Naval stuff, as it happens, which couldn’t suit Percy better, because he’s very
well in at the Admiralty; it’s his supporters’ club. So Percy gives his naval
friends a sneak preview and they water at the mouth. 'Where does it come from?
Will there be more?’ There’s plenty more. As to the identity of the source—well,
that’s a big big mystery at this stage, but so it should be. Forgive me if I’m a
little wide of the mark here and there, but I’ve only the file to go by.”

The mention of a file, the first indication that Smiley might be acting in some
official capacity, produced in Esterhase a discernible response. The habitual
licking of the lips was accompanied by a forward movement of the head and an
expression of shrewd familiarity, as if Toby by all these signals was trying to
indicate that he, too, had read the file, whatever file it was, and entirely shared
Smiley’s conclusions. Smiley had broken off to drink some tea.

“More for you, Toby?” he asked over his cup.

“I’ll get it,” said Guillam with more firmness than hospitality.

“Tea, Fawn,” he called through the door. It opened at once and Fawn appeared
on the threshold, cup in hand.

Smiley was back at the window. He had parted the curtain an inch, and was
staring into the square.

“Toby?”

“Yes, George?”

“Did you bring a baby-sitter?”

“No.”

“No one?”

“George, why should I bring baby-sitters if I am just going to meet Peter and a
poor Pole?”

Smiley returned to his chair. “Merlin as a source,” he resumed. “Where was I?
Yes, well, conveniently Merlin wasn’t just one source, was he, as little by little
Gerald explained to Percy and the two others he had by now drawn into the
magic circle. Merlin was a Soviet agent, all right, but, rather like Alleline, he
was also the spokesman of a dissident group. We love to see ourselves in other
people’s situations, and I’m sure Percy warmed to Merlin from the start. This
group, this caucus of which Merlin was the leader, was made up of, say, half a
dozen like-minded Soviet officials, each in his way well-placed. With time, I
suspect, Gerald gave his lieutenants, and Percy, a pretty close picture of these

sub-sources, but I don’t know. Merlin’s job was to collate their intelligence and
get it to the West, and over the next few months he showed remarkable
versatility in doing just that. He used all manner of methods, and the Circus was
only too willing to feed him the equipment. Secret writing, microdots stuck over
full stops on innocent-looking letters, dead letter-boxes in Western capitals, filled
by God knows what brave Russian, and dutifully cleared by Toby Esterhase’s
brave lamplighters. Live meetings, even, arranged and watched over by Toby’s
baby-sitters”—a minute pause as Smiley glanced again towards the window—“a
couple of drops in Moscow that had to be fielded by the local residency, though
they were never allowed to know their benefactor. But no clandestine radio;
Merlin doesn’t care for it. There was a proposal once—it even got as far as the
Treasury—to set up a permanent long-arm radio station in Finland, just to
service him, but it all foundered when Merlin said, 'Not on your nelly.’ He must
have been taking lessons from Karla, mustn’t he? You know how Karla hates
radio. The great thing is. Merlin has mobility: that’s his biggest talent. Perhaps
he’s in the Moscow Trade Ministry and can use the travelling salesmen. Anyway,
he has the resources and he has the leads out of Russia. And that’s why his
fellow conspirators look to him to deal with Gerald and agree to the terms, the
financial terms. Because they do want money. Lots of money. I should have
mentioned that. In that respect, secret services and their customers are like
anyone else. I’m afraid. They value most what costs most, and Merlin costs a
fortune. Ever bought a fake picture?”

“I sold a couple once,” said Toby with a flashy, nervous smile, but no one
laughed.

“The more you pay for it, the less inclined you are to doubt it. Silly, but there
we are. It’s also comforting for everyone to know that Merlin is venal. That’s a
motive we all understand—right, Toby? Specially in the Treasury. Twenty
thousand francs a month into a Swiss bank: well, there’s no knowing who
wouldn’t bend a few egalitarian principles for money like that. So Whitehall
pays him a fortune, and calls his intelligence priceless. And some of it is good,”
Smiley conceded. “Very good, I do think, and so it should be. Then, one day,
Gerald admits Percy to the greatest secret of all. The Merlin caucus has a
London end. It’s the start, I should tell you now, of a very, very clever knot.”

Toby put down his cup and with his handkerchief primly dabbed the corners
of his mouth.

“According to Gerald, a member of the Soviet Embassy here in London is
actually ready and able to act as Merlin’s London representative. He is even in
the extraordinary position of being able to use, on rare occasions, the Embassy
facilities to talk to Merlin in Moscow, to send and receive messages. And if

every imaginable precaution is taken, it is even possible now and then for Gerald
to arrange clandestine meetings with this wonder-man, to brief and debrief him,
to put follow-up questions and receive answers from Merlin almost by return of
post. We’ll call this Soviet official Aleksey Aleksandrovich Polyakov, and we’ll
pretend he’s a member of the cultural section of the Soviet Embassy. Are you
with me?”

“I didn’t hear anything,” said Esterhase. “I gone deaf.”

“The story is, he’s been a member of the London Embassy quite a while—
nine years, to be precise—but Merlin’s only recently added him to the flock.
While Polyakov was on leave in Moscow, perhaps?”

“I’m not hearing nothing.”

“Very quickly Polyakov becomes important, because before long Gerald
appoints him linchpin of the Witchcraft operation and a lot more besides. The
dead drops in Amsterdam and Paris, the secret inks, the microdots—they all go
on, all right, but at less of a pitch. The convenience of having Polyakov right on
the doorstep is too good to miss. Some of Merlin’s best material is smuggled to
London by diplomatic bag; all Polyakov has to do is slit open the envelopes and
pass them to his counterpart in the Gircus—Gerald or whomever Gerald
nominates. But we must never forget that this part of the Merlin operation is
deathly, deathly secret. The Witchcraft committee itself is, of course, secret, too,
but large. That’s inevitable. The operation is large, the take is large; processing
and distribution alone require a mass of clerical supervision—transcribers,
translators, codists, typists, evaluators, and God knows what. None of that
worries Gerald at all, of course: he likes it, in fact, because the art of being
Gerald is to be one of a crowd. Is the Witchcraft committee led from below?
From the middle or from the top? I rather like Karla’s description of committees,
don’t you? Is it Ghinese? A committee is an animal with four back legs.

“But the London end—Polyakov’s leg—that part is confined to the original
magic circle. Skordeno, de Silsky, all the pack: they can tear off abroad and devil
like mad for Merlin away from home. But here in London, the operation
involving Brother Polyakov, the way that knot is tied—that’s a very special
secret, for very special reasons. You, Percy, Bill Haydon, and Roy Bland. You
four are the magic circle. Right? Now let’s just speculate about how it works, in
detail. There’s a house, we know that. All the same, meetings there are very
elaborately arranged; we can be sure of that, can’t we? Who meets him, Toby?
Who has the handling of Polyakov? You? Roy? Bill?”

Taking the fat end of his tie, Smiley turned the silk lining outwards and
polished his glasses. “Everyone does,” he said, answering his own question.
“How’s that? Sometimes Percy meets him. I would guess Percy represents the

authoritarian side with him: 'Isn’t it time you took a holiday? Have you heard
from your wife this week?’ Percy would be good at that. But the Witchcraft
committee uses Percy sparingly. Percy’s the big gun and he must have rarity
value. Then there’s Bill Haydon; Bill meets him. That would happen more often,
I think. Bill’s impressive on Russia and he has entertainment value. I have a
feeling that he and Polyakov would hit it off pretty well. I would think Bill shone
when it came to the briefing and the follow-up questions, wouldn’t you? Making
certain that the right messages went to Moscow? Sometimes he takes Roy Bland
with him, sometimes he sends Roy on his own. I expect that’s something they
work out between themselves. And Roy, of course, is an economic expert, as
well as top man on satellites, so there’ll be lots to talk about in that department
also. And sometimes—I imagine birthdays, Toby, or a Christmas, or special
presentations of thanks and money—there’s a small fortune written down to
entertainment, I notice, let alone bounties. Sometimes, to make the party go, you
all four trot along, and raise your glasses to the king across the water: to Merlin,
through his envoy, Polyakov. Finally, I suppose, Toby himself has things to talk
to friend Polyakov about. There’s tradecraft to discuss; there are the useful
snippets about goings on inside the Embassy, which are so handy to the
lamplighters in their bread-and-butter surveillance operations against the
residency. So Toby also has his solo sessions. After all, we shouldn’t overlook
Polyakov’s local potential, quite apart from his role as Merlin’s London
representative. It’s not every day we have a tame Soviet diplomat in London
eating out of our hands. A little training with a camera and Polyakov could be
very useful just at the straight domestic level. Provided we all remember our
priorities.”

His gaze had not left Toby’s face. “I can imagine that Polyakov might run to
quite a few reels of film, can’t you? And that one of the jobs of whoever was
seeing him might be to replenish his stock: take him little sealed packets. Packets
of film. Unexposed film, of course, since it came from the Circus. Tell me, Toby
—could you, please—is the name Lapin familiar to you?”

A lick, a frown, a smile, a forward movement of the head: “Sure, George, I
know Lapin.”

“Who ordered the lamplighter reports on Lapin destroyed?”

“I did, George.”

“On your own initiative?”

The smile broadened a fraction. “Listen, George, I made some rungs up the
ladder these days.”

“Who said Connie Sachs had to be pushed downhill?”

“Look, I think it was Percy—okay? Say it was Percy, maybe Bill. You know

how it is in a big operation. Shoes to mend, pots to clean, always a thing going.”
He shrugged. “Maybe it was Roy, huh?”

“So you take orders from all of them,” said Smiley lightly. “That’s very
indiscriminate of you, Toby. You should know better.”

Esterhase didn’t like that at all.

“Who told you to cool off Max, Toby? Was it the same three people? Only I
have to report all this to Lacon, you see. He’s being awfully pressing just at the
moment. He seems to have the Minister on his back. Who was it?”

“George, you been talking to the wrong guys.”

“One of us has,” Smiley agreed pleasantly. “That’s for sure. They also want to
know about Westerby: just who put the muzzle on him. Was it the same person
who sent you down to Sarratt with a thousand quid in cash and a brief to put Jim
Prideaux’s mind at rest? It’s only facts I’m after, Toby, not scalps. You know me
—I’m not the vindictive sort. Anyway, what’s to say you’re not a very loyal
fellow? It’s just a question of who to.” He added, “Only they do badly want to
know, you see. There’s even some ugly talk of calling in the competition.

Nobody wants that, do they? It’s like going to solicitors when you’ve had a row
with your wife: an irrevocable step. Who gave you the message for Jim about
Tinker, Tailor? Did you know what it meant? Did you have it straight from
Polyakov, was that it?”

“For God’s sake,” Guillam whispered, “let me sweat the bastard.”

Smiley ignored him. “Let’s keep talking about Lapin. What was his job over
here?”

“He worked for Polyakov.”

“His secretary in the cultural department?”

“His legman.”

“But, my dear Toby, what on earth is a cultural attache doing with his own
legman?”

Esterhase’s eyes were on Smiley all the time. He’s like a dog, thought
Guillam; he doesn’t know whether to expect a kick or a bone. They flickered
from Smiley’s face to his hands, then back to his face, constantly checking the
telltale places.

“Don’t be damn silly, George,” Toby said carelessly. “Polyakov is working for
Moscow Gentre. You know that as well as I do.” He crossed his little legs and,
with a resurgence of all his former insolence, sat back in his chair and took a sip
of cold tea.

Whereas Smiley, to Guillam’s eye, appeared momentarily set back; from
which Guillam in his confusion dryly inferred that he was doubtless very pleased
with himself. Perhaps because Toby was at last doing the talking.

“Come on, George,” Toby said. “You’re not a child. Think how many
operations we ran this way. We buy Polyakov, okay? Polyakov’s a Moscow hood
but he’s our Joe. But he’s got to pretend to his own people that he’s spying on us.
How else does he get away with it? How does he walk in and out of that house
all day, no gorillas, no baby-sitters, everything so easy? He comes down to our
shop, so he got to take home the goodies. So we give him goodies. Chicken-feed,
so he can pass it home and everyone in Moscow claps him on the back and tells
him he’s a big guy—happens every day.”

If Guillam’s head by now was reeling with a kind of furious awe, Smiley’s
seemed remarkably clear.

“And that’s pretty much the standard story, is it, among the four initiated?”

“Well, standard I wouldn’t know,” said Esterhase, with a very Hungarian
movement of the hand, a spreading of the palm and a tilting either way.

“So who is Polyakov’s agent?”

The question, Guillam saw, mattered very much to Smiley: he had played the
whole long hand in order to arrive at it. As Guillam waited, his eyes now on
Esterhase, who was by no means so confident any more, now on Smiley’s
mandarin face, he realised that he, too, was beginning to understand the shape of
Karla’s last clever knot, as Smiley had called it—and of his own gruelling
interview with Alleline.

“What I’m asking you is very simple,” Smiley insisted. “Notionally, who is
Polyakov’s agent inside the Circus? Good heavens, Toby, don’t be obtuse. If
Polyakov’s cover for meeting you people is that he is spying on the Circus, then
he must have a Circus spy, mustn’t he? So who is he? He can’t come back to the
Embassy after a meeting with you people, loaded with reels of Circus chicken-
feed, and say, T got this from the boys.’ There has to be a story—and a good
one, at that: a whole history of courtship, recruitment, clandestine meetings,
money, and motive. Doesn’t there? Heavens, this isn’t just Polyakov’s cover
story: it’s his life-line. It’s got to be thorough. It’s got to be convincing; I’d say it
was a very big issue in the game. So who is he?” Smiley enquired pleasantly.
“You? Toby Esterhase masquerades as a Circus traitor in order to keep Polyakov
in business? My hat, Toby, that’s worth a whole handful of medals.”

They waited while Toby thought.

“You’re on a damn long road, George,” Toby said at last. “What happens you
don’t reach the other end?”

“Even with Eacon behind me?”

“You bring Eacon here. Percy, too; Bill. Why you come to the little guy? Go
to the big ones, pick on them.”

“I thought you were a big guy these days. You’d be a good choice for the part.

Toby. Hungarian ancestry, resentment about promotion, reasonable access but
not too much ... quick-witted, likes money ... With you as his agent, Polyakov
would have a cover story that really sits up and works. The big three give you
the chicken-feed, you hand it to Polyakov, Centre thinks Toby is all theirs,
everyone’s served, everyone’s content. The only problem arises when it
transpires that you’ve been handing Polyakov the crown jewels and getting
Russian chicken-feed in return. If that should turn out to be the case, you’re
going to need pretty good friends. Like us. That’s how my thesis runs—^just to
complete it. That Gerald is a Russian mole, run by Karla. And he’s pulled the
Circus inside out.”

Esterhase looked slightly ill. “George, listen. If you’re wrong, I don’t want to
be wrong too, get me?”

“But if he’s right, you want to be right,” Guillam suggested, in a rare
interruption. “And the sooner you’re right, the happier you’ll be.”

“Sure,” said Toby, quite unaware of any irony. “Sure. I mean George got a
nice idea, but Jesus, there’s two sides to everyone, George, agents specially, and
maybe it’s you who got the wrong one. Listen: who ever called Witchcraft
chicken-feed? No one. Never. It’s the best. You get one guy with a big mouth
starts shouting the dirt, and you dug up half London already. Get me? Look, I do
what they tell me. Okay? They say act the stooge for Polyakov, I act him. Pass
him this film, I pass it. I’m in a very dangerous situation,” he explained. “For
me, very dangerous indeed.”

“I’m sorry about that,” said Smiley at the window, where through a chink in
the curtain he was once more studying the square. “Must be worrying for you.”

“Extremely,” Toby agreed. “I get ulcers, can’t eat. Very bad predicament.”

For a moment, to Guillam’s fury, they were all three joined in a sympathetic
silence over Toby Esterhase’s bad predicament.

“Toby, you wouldn’t be lying about those baby-sitters, would you?” Smiley
enquired, still from the window.

“George, I cross my heart, I swear you.”

“What would you use for a job like this? Cars?”

“Pavement artists. Put a bus back by the air terminal, walk them through, turn
’em over.”

“How many?”

“Eight, ten. This time of year—six, maybe. We get a lot ill. Christmas,” he
said morosely.

“And one man alone?”

“Never. You crazy. One man! You think I run a toffee shop these days?”

Leaving the window, Smiley sat down again.

“Listen, George, that’s a terrible idea you got there, you know that? I’m a
patriotic fellow. Jesus,” Toby repeated.

“What is Polyakov’s job in the London residency?” Smiley asked.

“Polly works solo.”

“Running his master spy inside the Circus?”

“Sure. They take him off regular work, give him a free hand so’s he can
handle Toby, master spy. We work it all out; hours on end I sit with him. 'Listen,’
I say. 'Bill is suspecting me, my wife is suspecting me, my kid got measles, and I
can’t pay the doctor.’ All the crap that agents give you, I give it to Polly so’s he
can pass it home for real.”

“And who’s Merlin?”

Esterhase shook his head.

“But at least you’ve heard he’s based in Moscow,” Smiley said. “And a
member of the Soviet intelligence establishment, whatever else he isn’t?”

“That much they tell me,” Esterhase agreed.

“Which is how Polyakov can communicate with him. In the Circus’s interest,
of course. Secretly, without his own people becoming suspicious?”

“Sure.” Toby resumed his lament, but Smiley seemed to be listening to sounds
that were not in the room.

“And Tinker, Tailor?”

“I don’t know what the hell it is. I do what Percy tells me.”

“And Percy told you to square Jim Prideaux?”

“Sure. Maybe it was Bill. Or Roy, maybe. Listen, it was Roy. I got to eat,
George, understand? I don’t cut my throat two ways, follow me?”

“It is the perfect fix; you see that, don’t you, Toby, really?” Smiley remarked
in a quiet, rather distant way. “Assuming it is a fix. It makes everyone wrong
who’s right: Connie Sachs, Jerry Westerby . . . Jim Prideaux . . . even Control.
Silences the doubters before they’ve even spoken out... The permutations are
infinite, once you’ve brought off the basic lie. Moscow Centre must be allowed
to think she has an important Circus source; Whitehall on no account must get
wind of the same notion. Take it to its logical conclusion and Gerald would have
us strangling our own children in their beds. It would be beautiful in another
context,” he remarked almost dreamily. “Poor Toby; yes, I do see. What a time
you must have been having, running between them all.”

Toby had his next speech ready: “Naturally, if there is anything I can do of a
practical nature, you know me, George, I am always pleased to help—no trouble.
My boys are pretty well trained; you want to borrow them, maybe we can work a
deal. Naturally, I have to speak to Lacon first. All I want, I want to get this thing
cleared up. For the sake of the Circus, you know. That’s all I want. The good of

the firm. I’m a modest man; I don’t want anything for myself—okay?”

“Where’s this safe house you keep exclusively for Polyakov?”

“Five Lock Gardens, Camden Town.”

“With a caretaker?”

“Mrs. McCraig.”

“Lately a listener?”

“Sure.”

“Is there built-in audio?”

“What do you think?”

“So Millie McCraig keeps house and mans the recording instruments.”

She did, said Toby, ducking his head with great alertness.

“In a minute, I want you to telephone her and tell her I’m staying the night
and I’ll want to use the equipment. Tell her I’ve been called in on a special job
and she’s to do whatever I ask. I’ll be round about nine. What’s the procedure for
contacting Polyakov if you want a crash meeting?”

“My boys have a room on Haverstock Hill. Polly drives past the window each
morning on the way to the Embassy, each night going home. If they put up a
yellow poster protesting against traffic, that’s the signal.”

“And at night? At weekends?”

“Wrong-number phone call. But nobody likes that.”

“Has it ever been used?”

“I don’t know.”

“You mean you don’t listen to his phone?”

No answer.

“I want you to take the weekend off. Would that raise eyebrows at the
Circus?” Enthusiastically, Esterhase shook his head. “I’m sure you’d prefer to be
out of it, anyway, wouldn’t you?” Esterhase nodded. “Say you’re having girl
trouble or whatever sort of trouble you’re in these days. You’ll be spending the
night here, possibly two. Fawn will look after you; there’s food in the kitchen.
What about your wife?”

While Guillam and Smiley looked on, Esterhase dialled the Circus and asked
for Phil Porteous. He said his lines perfectly: a little self-pity, a little conspiracy,
a little joke. Some girl who was passionate about him up north, Phil, and
threatening wild things if he didn’t go and hold her hand.

“Don’t tell me, I know it happens to you every day, Phil. Hey, how’s that
gorgeous new secretary of yours? And listen, Phil, if Mara phones from home,
tell her Toby’s on a big job, okay? Blowing up the Kremlin, back on Monday.
Make it nice and heavy, huh? Cheers, Phil.”

He rang off and dialled a number in north London. “Mrs. M., hullo, this is

your favourite boyfriend—recognise the voice? Good. Listen, I’m sending you a
visitor tonight—an old, old friend, you’ll be surprised. She hates me,” he
explained to them, his hand over the mouthpiece. “He wants to check the
wiring,” he went on. “Look it all over, make sure it’s working okay, no bad leaks
—all right?”

“If he’s any trouble,” Guillam said to Fawn with real venom as they left, “bind
him hand and foot.”

In the stairwell, Smiley lightly touched his arm. “Peter, I want you to watch
my back. Will you do that for me? Give me a couple of minutes, then pick me up
on the corner of Marloes Road, heading north. Stick to the west pavement.”

Guillam waited, then stepped into the street. A thin drizzle lay on the air, which
had an eerie warmness like a thaw. Where lights shone, the moisture shifted in
fine clouds, but in shadow he neither saw nor felt it: simply, a mist blurred his
vision, making him half close his eyes. He completed one round of the gardens,
then entered a pretty mews well south of the pick-up point. Reaching Marloes
Road, he crossed to the west pavement, bought an evening paper, and began
walking at a leisurely rate past villas set in deep gardens. He was counting off
pedestrians, cyclists, cars, while out ahead of him, steadily plodding the far
pavement, he picked out George Smiley, the very prototype of the homegoing
Londoner. “Is it a team?” Guillam had asked. Smiley could not be specific.
“Short of Abingdon Villas, I’ll cross over,” he said. “Look for a solo. But look!”

As Guillam watched Smiley pulled up abruptly, as if he had just remembered
something, stepped perilously into the road, and scuttled between the angry
traffic to disappear at once through the doors of a liquor store. As he did so,
Guillam saw, or thought he saw, a tall crooked figure in a dark coat step out after
him, but at that moment a bus drew up, screening both Smiley and his pursuer;
and when it pulled away, it must have taken his pursuer with it, for the only
survivor on that strip of pavement was an older man in a black plastic raincoat
and cloth cap lolling at the bus stop while he read his evening paper; and when
Smiley emerged from the store with his brown bag, the man did not so much as
lift his head from the sporting pages. For a short while longer, Guillam trailed
Smiley through the smarter reaches of Victorian Kensington as he slipped from
one quiet square to another, sauntered into a mews and out again by the same
route. Only once, when Guillam forgot Smiley and out of instinct turned upon
his own tracks, did he have a suspicion of a third figure walking with them: a
fanged shadow thrown against the broadloom brickwork of an empty street, but
when he started forward, it was gone.

The night had its own madness after that; events ran too quickly for him to

fasten on them singly. Not till days afterwards did he realise that the figure, or
the shadow of it, had struck a chord of familiarity in his memory. Even then, for
some time, he could not place it. Then one early morning, waking abruptly, he
had it clear in his mind: a barking, military voice, a gentleness of manner heavily
concealed, a squash racket jammed behind the safe of his room in Brixton,
which brought tears to the eyes of his unemotional secretary.
