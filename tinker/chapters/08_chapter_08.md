“Perhaps she was ill,” said Smiley stolidly, speaking more to Guillam than
anyone else. “Perhaps she was in a coma. Perhaps they were real nurses who
took her away. By the sound of her, she was a pretty good mess, at best.” He
added, with half a glance at Tarr: “After all, only twenty-four hours had elapsed
between your first telegram and Irina’s departure. You can hardly lay it at
London’s door on that timing.”

“You can just, ” said Guillam, looking at the floor. “It’s extremely fast, but it
does just work, if somebody in London—” They were all waiting. “If somebody
in London had very good footwork. And in Moscow, too, of course.”

“Now, that’s exactly what 1 told myself, sir,” said Tarr proudly, taking up
Smiley’s point and ignoring Guillam’s. “My very words, Mr. Smiley. 'Relax,
Ricki,’ 1 said; 'you’ll be shooting at shadows if you’re not damn careful.’ ”

“Or the Russians tumbled to her,” Smiley said. “The security guards found out
about your affair and removed her. It would be a wonder if they hadn’t found
out, the way you two carried on.”

“Or she told her husband,” Tarr suggested. “1 understand psychology as well
as the next man, sir. 1 know what can happen between a husband and wife when
they have fallen out. She wishes to annoy him. To goad him, to obtain a reaction,
1 thought. 'Want to hear what I’ve been doing while you’ve been out boozing
and cutting the rug?’—like that. Boris peels off and tells the gorillas; they
sandbag her and take her home. 1 went through all those possibilities, Mr.

Smiley, believe me. 1 really worked on them, truth. Same as any man does whose
woman walks out on him.”

“Let’s just have the story, shall we?” Guillam whispered, furious.

Well, now, said Tarr, he would agree that for twenty-four hours he went a bit
berserk: “Now, 1 don’t often get that way—right, Mr. Guillam?”

“Often enough.”

“1 was feeling pretty physical. Frustrated, you could almost say.”

His conviction that a considerable prize had been brutally snatched away from
him drove him to a distracted fury that found expression in a rampage through
old haunts. He went to the Gat’s Gradle, then to Angelika’s, and by dawn he had
taken in half a dozen other places besides, not to mention a few girls along the
way. At some point he crossed town and raised a spot of dust around the
Alexandra. He was hoping to have a couple of words with those security
gorillas. When he sobered down, he got thinking about Irina and their time

together, and he decided before he flew back to London to go round their dead
letter-boxes to check whether by any chance she had written to him before she
left.

Partly it was something to do. “Partly, I guess, I couldn’t bear to think of a
letter of hers kicking around in a hole in a wall while she sweated it out in the
hot seat,” he added, the ever-redeemable boy.

They had two places where they dropped mail for one another. The first was
not far from the hotel on a building site.

“Ever seen that bamboo scaffolding they use? Fantastic. I’ve seen it twenty
storeys high and the coolies swarming over it with slabs of precast concrete.” A
bit of discarded piping, he said, handy at shoulder height. It seemed most likely,
if Irina was in a hurry, that the piping was the letter-box she would use, but when
Tarr went there it was empty. The second was back by the church, “in under
where they stow the pamphlets,” as he put it. “This stand was part of an old
wardrobe, see. If you kneel in the back pew and grope around, there’s a loose
board. Behind the board there’s a recess full of rubbish and rat’s mess. I tell you,
it made a real lovely drop, the best ever.”

There was a short pause, illuminated by the vision of Ricki Tarr and his
Moscow Centre mistress kneeling side by side in the rear pew of a Baptist
church in Hong Kong.

In this dead letter-box, Tarr said, he found not a letter but a whole damn diary.
The writing was fine and done on both sides of the paper, so that quite often the
black ink came through. It was fast urgent writing with no erasures. He knew at a
glance that she had maintained it in her lucid periods.

“This isn’t it, mind. This is only my copy.”

Slipping a long hand inside his shirt, he had drawn out a leather purse attached
to a broad thong of hide. From it he took a grimy wad of paper.

“I guess she dropped the diary just before they hit her,” he said. “Maybe she
was having a last pray at the same time. I made the translation myself.”

“I didn’t know you spoke Russian,” said Smiley—a comment lost to everyone
but Tarr, who at once grinned.

“Ah, now, a man needs a qualification in this profession, Mr. Smiley,” he
explained as he separated the pages. “I may not have been too great at law but a
further language can be decisive. You know what the poets say, I expect?” He
looked up from his labours and his grin widened. “ To possess another language
is to possess another soul.’ A great king wrote that, sir, Charles the Fifth. My
father never forgot a quotation. I’ll say that for him, though the funny thing is he
couldn’t speak a damn thing but English. I’ll read the diary aloud to you, if you
don’t mind.”

“He hasn’t a word of Russian to his name,” said Guillam.

“They spoke English all the time. Irina had done a three-year English course.”

Guillam had chosen the ceiling to look at, Eacon his hands. Only Smiley was
watching Tarr, who was laughing quietly at his own little joke.

“All set?” he enquired. “Right, then. I’ll begin. Thomas, listen, I am talking
to you.’ She called me by my surname,” he explained. “I told her I was Tony, but
it was always Thomas, right? This diary is my gift for you in case they take me
away before I speak to Alleline. I would prefer to give you my life, Thomas, and
naturally my body, but I think it more likely that this wretched secret will be all I
have to make you happy. Use it well!’ ” Tarr glanced up. “It’s marked Monday.
She wrote the diary over the four days.” His voice had become flat, almost
bored. “ Tn Moscow Gentre there is more gossip than our superiors would wish.
Especially the little fellows like to make themselves grand by appearing to be in
the know. For two years before I was attached to the Trade Ministry, I worked as
a supervisor in the filing department of our headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square.
The work was so dull, Thomas, the atmosphere was not happy, and I was
unmarried. We were encouraged to be suspicious of one another; it is such a
strain never to give your heart, not once. Under me was a clerk named Ivlov.
Though Ivlov was not socially or in rank my equal, the oppressive atmosphere
brought out a mutuality in our temperaments. Forgive me, sometimes only the
body can speak for us—you should have appeared earlier, Thomas! Several
times Ivlov and I worked night shifts together, and eventually we agreed to defy
regulations and meet outside the building. He was blond, Thomas, like you, and
I wanted him. We met in a cafe in a poor district of Moscow. In Russia we are
taught that Moscow has no poor districts, but this is a lie. Ivlov told me that his
real name was Brod but he was not a Jew. He brought me some coffee sent to
him illicitly by a comrade in Teheran—he was very sweet—also some stockings.
Ivlov told me that he admired me greatly and that he had once worked in a
section responsible for recording the particulars of all the foreign agents
employed by Gentre. I laughed and told him that no such record existed; it was
an idea of dreamers to suppose so many secrets would be in one place. Well, we
were both dreamers I suppose.’ ”

Again Tarr broke off. “We get a new day,” he announced. “She kicks off with
a lot of 'good morning Thomas’s,’ prayers, and a bit of love-talk. A woman can’t
write to the air, she says, so she’s writing to Thomas. Her old man’s gone out
early; she’s got an hour to herself. Okay?”

Smiley grunted.

“ 'On the second occasion with Ivlov, I met him in the room of a cousin of
Ivlov’s wife, a teacher at Moscow State University. No one else was present. The

meeting, which was extremely secret, involved what in a report we would call an
incriminating act. 1 think, Thomas, you yourself once or twice committed such
an act! Also at this meeting Ivlov told me the following story to bind us in even
closer friendship. Thomas, you must take care. Have you heard of Karla? He is
an old fox, the most cunning in the Centre, the most secret; even his name is not
a name that Russians understand. Ivlov was extremely frightened to tell me this
story, which according to Ivlov concerned a great conspiracy, perhaps the
greatest we have. The story of Ivlov is as follows. You should tell it only to most
trustworthy people, Thomas, because of its extremely conspiratorial nature. You
must tell no one in the Circus, for no one can be trusted until the riddle is solved.
Ivlov said it was not true that he once worked on agent records. He had invented
this story only to show me the great depth of his knowledge concerning the
Centre’s affairs and to assure me that 1 was not in love with a nobody. The truth
was he had worked for Karla as a helper in one of Karla’s great conspiracies and
he had actually been stationed in England in a conspiratorial capacity, under the
cover of being a driver and assistant coding clerk at the Embassy. For this task
he was provided with the workname Lapin. Thus Brod became Ivlov and Ivlov
became Lapin: of this poor Ivlov was extremely proud. (1 did not tell him what
Lapin means in French.) That a man’s wealth should be counted by the number
of his names! Ivlov’s task was to service a mole. A mole is a deep-penetration
agent so called because he burrows deep into the fabric of Western imperialism,
in this case an Englishman. Moles are very precious to the Centre because of the
many years it takes to place them, often fifteen or twenty. Most of the English
moles were recruited by Karla before the war and came from the higher
bourgeoisie, even aristocrats and nobles who were disgusted with their origins,
and became secretly fanatic, much more fanatic than their working-class English
comrades, who are slothful. Several were applying to join the Party when Karla
stopped them in time and directed them to special work. Some fought in Spain
against Franco Fascism, and Karla’s talent-spotters found them there and turned
them over to Karla for recruitment. Others were recruited in the war during the
alliance of expediency between Soviet Russia and Britain. Others afterwards,
disappointed that the war did not bring Socialism to the West...’ It kind of dries
up here,” Tarr announced without looking anywhere but at his own manuscript.

“1 wrote down, 'dries up.’ 1 guess her old man came back earlier than she
expected. The ink’s all blotted. God knows where she stowed the damn thing.
Under the mattress maybe.”

If this was meant as a joke, it failed.

“The mole whom Lapin serviced in London was known by the code name
Gerald. He had been recruited by Karla and was the object of extreme

conspiracy. The servicing of moles is performed only by comrades with a very
high standard of ability, said Ivlov. Thus while in appearance Ivlov-Lapin was at
the Embassy a mere nobody, subjected to many humiliations on account of his
apparent insignificance, such as standing with women behind the bar at
functions, by right he was a great man, the secret assistant to Colonel Gregor
Viktorov, whose workname at the Embassy is Polyakov.’ ”

Here Smiley made his one interjection, asking for the spelling. Like an actor
disturbed in midflow, Tarr answered rudely, “P-o-l-y-a-k-o-v, got it?”

“Thank you,” said Smiley with unshakeable courtesy, in a manner which
conveyed conclusively that the name had no significance for him whatever. Tarr
resumed.

“ ' Viktorov is himself an old professional of great cunning, said Ivlov. His
cover job is cultural attache and that is how he speaks to Karla. As Cultural
Attache Polyakov, he organises lectures to British universities and societies
concerning cultural matters in the Soviet Union, but his nightwork as Colonel
Gregor Viktorov is briefing and debriefing the mole Gerald on instruction from
Karla at Centre. For this purpose. Colonel Viktorov-Polyakov uses legmen and
poor Ivlov was for a while one. Nevertheless it is Karla in Moscow who is the
real controller of the mole Gerald.’ ”

“Now it really changes,” said Tarr. “She’s writing at night and she’s either
plastered or scared out of her pants, because she’s going all over the damn page.
There’s talk about footsteps in the corridor and the dirty looks she’s getting from
the gorillas. Not transcribed—right, Mr. Smiley?” And, receiving a small nod, he
went on: “ The measures for the mole’s security were remarkable. Written
reports from London to Karla at Moscow Centre even after coding were cut in
two and sent by separate couriers, others in secret inks underneath orthodox
Embassy correspondence. Ivlov told me that the mole Gerald produced at times
more conspiratorial material than Viktorov-Polyakov could conveniently handle.
Much was on undeveloped film, often thirty reels in a week. Anyone opening the
container in the wrong fashion at once exposed the film. Other material was
given by the mole in speeches, at extremely conspiratorial meetings, and
recorded on special tape that could only be played through complicated
machines. This tape was also wiped clean by exposure to light or to the wrong
machine. The meetings were of the crash type, always different, always sudden,
that is all I know except that it was the time when the Fascist aggression in
Vietnam was at its worst; in England the extreme reactionaries had again taken
the power. Also that according to Ivlov-Lapin, the mole Gerald was a high
functionary in the Circus. Thomas, I tell you this because, since I love you, I
have decided to admire all English, you most of all. I do not wish to think of an

English gentleman behaving as a traitor, though naturally I believe he was right
to join the workers’ cause. Also I fear for the safety of anyone employed by the
Circus in a conspiracy. Thomas, I love you; take care with this knowledge—it
could hurt you also. Ivlov was a man like you, even if they called him Lapin ...’
” Tarr paused diffidently. “There’s a bit at the end which ...”

“Read it,” Guiham murmured.

Lifting the wad of paper slightly sideways, Tarr read in the same flat drawl: “
Thomas, I am telling you this also because I am afraid. This morning when I
woke, he was sitting on the bed, staring at me like a madman. When I went
downstairs for coffee, the guards Trepov and Novikov watched me like animals,
eating very carelessly. I am sure they had been there hours; also from the
Residency, Avilov sat with them, a boy. Have you been indiscreet, Thomas? Did
you tell more than you let me think? Now you see why only Aheline would do.
You need not blame yourself; I can guess what you have told them. In my heart I
am free. You have seen only the bad things in me—the drink, the fear, the lies
we live. But deep inside me burns a new and blessed light. I used to think that
the secret world was a separate place and that I was banished for ever to an
island of half-people. But, Thomas, it is not separate. God has shown me that it
is here, right in the middle of the real world, ah round us, and we have only to
open the door and step outside to be free. Thomas, you must always long for the
light which I have found. It is called love. Now I shall take this to our secret
place and leave it there while there is still time.

Dear God, I hope there is. God give me sanctuary in His Church. Remember
it: I loved you there also.’ ” Tarr was extremely pale, and his hands, as he pulled
open his shirt to return the diary to its purse, were trembling and moist. “There’s
a last bit,” he said. “It goes: Thomas, why could you remember so few prayers
from your boyhood? Your father was a great and good man.’ Like I told you,” he
explained, “she was crazy.”

Lacon had opened the blinds and now the full white light of day was pouring
into the room. The windows looked onto a small paddock where Jackie Lacon, a
fat little girl in plaits and a riding hat, was cautiously cantering her pony.
