To her credit, Matron had been worried about Roach all week, ever since she
had spotted him alone in the washroom, ten minutes after the rest of his
dormitory had gone down to breakfast, still in his pyjama trousers, hunched over
a basin while he doggedly scrubbed his teeth. When she questioned him, he
avoided her eye. “It’s that wretched father of his,” she told Thursgood. “He’s
getting him down again.” And by the Friday: “You must write to the mother and
tell her he’s having a spell.”

But not even Matron, for all her motherly perception, would have hit on plain
terror as the diagnosis.

Whatever could he do—he, a child? That was his guilt. That was the threat
that led directly back to the misfortune of his parents. That was the predicament
that threw upon his hunched shoulders the responsibility night and day for
preserving the world’s peace. Roach, the watcher—“best watcher in the whole
damn unit,” to use Jim Prideaux’s treasured words—had finally watched too
well. He would have sacrificed everything he possessed—his money, his leather
photograph case of his parents, whatever gave him value in the world—if it
would buy him release from the knowledge that had consumed him since Sunday
evening.

He had put out signals. On Sunday night, an hour after lights out, he had gone
noisily to the lavatory, probed his throat, gagged, and finally vomited. But the
dormitory monitor, who was supposed to wake and raise the alarm—“Matron,
Roach’s been sick”—slept stubbornly through the whole charade. Roach
clambered miserably back to bed. From the call-box outside the staffroom next
afternoon, he had dialled the menu for the day and whispered strangely into the
mouthpiece, hoping to be overheard by a master and taken for mad. No one paid
him any attention. He had tried mixing up reality with dreams, in the hope that
the event would be converted into something he had imagined; but each morning
as he passed the Dip he saw again Jim’s crooked figure stooping over the spade
in the moonlight; he saw the black shadow of his face under the brim of his old
hat, and heard the grunt of effort as he dug.

Roach should never have been there. That also was his guilt: that the
knowledge was acquired by sin. After a cello lesson on the far side of the
village, he had returned to school with deliberate slowness in order to be too late
for evensong, and Mrs. Thursgood’s disapproving eye. The whole school was
worshipping, all but himself and Jim: he heard them sing the Te Deum as he

passed the church, taking the long route so that he could skirt the Dip, where
Jim’s light was glowing. Standing in his usual place. Roach watched Jim’s
shadow move slowly across the curtained window. He’s turning in early, he
decided with approval as the light suddenly went out; for Jim had recently been
too absent for his taste, driving off in the Alvis after rugger and not returning till
Roach was asleep. Then the trailer door opened and closed, and Jim was
standing at the vegetable patch with a spade in his hand and Roach in great
perplexity was wondering what on earth he should be wanting to dig for in the
dark. Vegetables for his supper? For a moment Jim stood very still, listening to
the Te Deum; then glared slowly round and straight at Roach, though he was out
of sight against the blackness of the hummocks. Roach even thought of calling to
him, but felt too sinful on account of missing chapel.

Finally Jim began measuring. That, at least, was how it seemed to Roach.
Instead of digging, he had knelt at one corner of the patch and laid the spade on
the earth, as if aligning it with something that was out of sight to Roach: for
instance, the church spire. This done, Jim strode quickly to where the blade lay,
marked the spot with a thud of his heel, took up the spade, and dug fast—Roach
counted twelve times—then stood back, taking stock again. From the church,
silence; then prayers. Quickly stooping, Jim drew a package from the ground,
which he at once smothered in the folds of his duffel coat. Seconds later, and
much faster than seemed possible, the trailer door slammed, the light went on
again, and in the boldest moment of his life Bill Roach tiptoed down the Dip to
within three feet of the poorly curtained window, using the slope to give himself
the height he needed to look in.

Jim stood at the table. On the bunk behind him lay a heap of exercise books, a
vodka bottle, and an empty glass. He must have dumped them there to make
space. He had a penknife ready but he wasn’t using it. Jim would never have cut
string if he could avoid it. The package was a foot long and made of yellowy
stuff like a tobacco pouch. Pulling it open, he drew out what seemed to be a
monkey wrench wrapped in sacking. But who would bury a monkey wrench,
even for the best car England ever made? The screws or bolts were in a separate
yellow envelope; he spilled them on to the table and examined each in turn. Not
screws: pen-tops. Not pen-tops, either; but they had sunk out of sight.

And not a monkey wrench, not a spanner—nothing, but absolutely nothing,
for the car.

Roach had blundered wildly to the brow. He was running between the
hummocks, making for the drive, but running slower than he had ever run
before; running through sand and deep water and dragging grass, gulping the
night air, sobbing it out again, running lopsidedly like Jim, pushing now with

this leg, now with the other, flailing with his head for extra speed. He had no
thought for where he was heading. All his awareness was behind him, fixed on
the black revolver and the bands of chamois leather; on the pen-tops that turned
to bullets as Jim threaded them methodically into the chamber, his lined face
tipped towards the lamplight, pale and slightly squinting in the dazzle.
