Before Tarr left, Smiley asked a number of questions of him. He was gazing not
at Tarr but myopically into the middle distance, his pouchy face despondent from
the tragedy.

“Where is the original of that diary?”

“I put it straight back in the dead letter-box. Figure it this way, Mr. Smiley: by
the time I found the diary, Irina had been in Moscow twenty-four hours. I
guessed she wouldn’t have a lot of breath when it came to the interrogation.

Most likely they’d sweated her on the plane, then a second going over when she
touched down, then question one as soon as the big boys had finished their
breakfast. That’s the way they do it to the timid ones: the arm first and the
questions after, right? So it might be only a matter of a day or two before Centre
sent along a footpad to take a peek round the back of the church, okay?” Primly
again: “Also I had my own welfare to consider.”

“He means that Moscow Centre would be less interested in cutting his throat
if they thought he hadn’t read the diary,” said Guillam.

“Did you photograph it?”

“I don’t carry a camera. I bought a dollar notebook. I copied the diary into the
notebook. The original I put back. The whole job took me four hours flat.” He
glanced at Guillam, then away from him. In the fresh daylight, a deep inner fear
was suddenly apparent in Tarr’s face. “When I got back to the hotel, my room
was a wreck; they’d even stripped the paper off the walls. The manager told me,
'Get the hell out.’ He didn’t want to know.”

“He’s carrying a gun,” said Guillam. “He won’t part with it.”

“You’re damn right I won’t.”

Smiley offered a dyspeptic grunt of sympathy. “These meetings you had with
Irina: the dead letter-boxes, the safety signals, and fallbacks. Who proposed the
tradecraft, you or she?”

“She did.”

“What were the safety signals?”

“Body-talk. If I wore my collar open, she knew I’d had a look around and I
reckoned the coast was clear. If I wore it closed, scrub the meeting till the
fallback.”

“And Irina?”

“Handbag. Left hand, right hand. I got there first and waited up somewhere
she could see me. That gave her the choice: whether to go ahead or split.”

“All this happened more than six months ago. What have you been doing
since?”

“Resting,” said Tarr rudely.

Guillam said, “He panicked and went native. He bolted to Kuala Lumpur, then
lay up in one of the hill villages. That’s his stoiy. He has a daughter called
Danny.”

“Danny’s my little kid.”

“He shacked up with Danny and her mother,” said Guillam, talking, as was his
habit, clean across anything Tarr said. “He’s got wives scattered across the globe,
but she seems to lead the pack just now.”

“Why did you choose this particular moment to come to us?”

Tarr said nothing.

“Don’t you want to spend Ghristmas with Danny?”

“Sure.”

“So what happened? Did something scare you?”

“There was rumours,” said Tarr sullenly.

“What sort of rumours?”

“Some Frenchman turned up in K.L. telling them all I owed him money.
Wanted to get some lawyer hounding me. I don’t owe anybody money.”

Smiley returned to Guillam. “At the Gircus he’s still posted as a defector?”

“Presumed.”

“What have they done about it so far?”

“It’s out of my hands. I heard on the grapevine that London Station held a
couple of war parties over him a while back, but they didn’t invite me and I
don’t know what came of them. Nothing, I should think, as usual.”

“What passport’s he been using?”

Tarr had his answer ready: “I threw away Thomas the day I hit Malaya. I
reckoned Thomas wasn’t exactly the flavour of the month in Moscow and I’d do
better to kill him off right there. In K.L. I had them run me up a British.” He
handed it to Smiley. “Name of Poole. It’s not bad for the money.”

“Why didn’t you use one of your Swiss escapes?”

Another wary pause.

“Or did you lose them when your hotel room was searched?”

Guillam said, “He cached them as soon as he arrived in Hong Kong. Standard
practice.”

“So why didn’t you use them?”

“They were numbered, Mr. Smiley. They may have been blank but they were
numbered. I was feeling a mite windy, frankly. If London had the numbers,
maybe Moscow did, too, if you take my meaning.”

“So what did you do with your Swiss escapes?” Smiley repeated pleasantly.

“He says he threw them away,” said Guillam. “He sold them, more likely. Or
swapped them for that one.”

“How? Threw them away how? Did you burn them?”

“That’s right, I burned them,” said Tarr with a nervy ring to his voice, half a
threat, half fear.

“So when you say this Frenchman was enquiring for you—”

“He was looking for Poole.”

“But who else ever heard of Poole, except the man who faked this passport?”
Smiley asked, turning the pages. Tarr said nothing. “Tell me how you travelled
to England,” Smiley suggested.

“Soft route from Dublin. No problem.” Tarr lied badly under pressure.

Perhaps his parents were to blame. He was too fast when he had no answer
ready, too aggressive when he had one up his sleeve.

“How did you get to Dublin?” Smiley asked, checking the border stamps on
the middle page.

“Roses.” He had recovered his confidence. “Roses all the way. I’ve got a girl
who’s an air hostess with South African. A pal of mine flew me cargo to the
Cape; at the Cape my girl took care of me, then hitched me a free ride to Dublin
with one of the pilots. As far as anyone back East knows, I never left the
peninsula.”

“I’m doing what I can to check,” said Guillam to the ceiling.

“Well, you be damn careful, baby,” Tarr snapped down the line to Guillam.
“Because I don’t want the wrong people on my back.”

“Why did you come to Mr. Guillam?” Smiley enquired, still deep in Poole’s
passport. It had a used, well-thumbed look, neither too full nor too empty. “Apart
from the fact that you were frightened, of course.”

“Mr. Guillam’s my boss,” said Tarr virtuously.

“Did it cross your mind he might just turn you straight over to Alleline? After
all, you’re something of a wanted man as far as the Circus top brass is
concerned, aren’t you?”

“Sure. But I don’t figure Mr. Guillam’s any fonder of the new arrangement
than you are, Mr. Smiley.”

“He also loves England,” Guillam explained with mordant sarcasm.

“Sure. I got homesick.”

“Did you ever consider going to anyone else but Mr. Guillam? Why not one of
the overseas residencies, for instance, where you were in less danger? Is
Mackelvore still headman in Paris?” Guillam nodded. “There you are, then: you
could have gone to Mr. Mackelvore. He recruited you, you can trust him: he’s

old Circus. You could have sat safely in Paris instead of risking your neck over
here. Oh, dear God. Lacon, quick!”

Smiley had risen to his feet, the back of one hand pressed to his mouth as he
stared out the window. In the paddock Jackie Lacon was lying on her stomach
screaming while a riderless pony careered between the trees. They were still
watching as Lacon’s wife, a pretty woman with long hair and thick winter
stockings, bounded over the fence and gathered the child up.

“They’re often taking tumbles,” Lacon remarked, quite cross. “They don’t
hurt themselves at that age.” And scarcely more graciously: “You’re not
responsible for everyone, you know, George.”

Slowly they settled again.

“And if you had been making for Paris,” Smiley resumed, “which route would
you have taken?”

“The same till Ireland, then Dublin-Orly, I guess. What do you expect me to
do—walk on the damn water?”

At this Lacon coloured and Guillam with an angry exclamation rose to his
feet. But Smiley seemed quite unbothered. Taking up the passport again, he
turned slowly back to the beginning.

“And how did you get in touch with Mr. Guillam?”

Guillam answered for him, speaking fast: “He knew where I garage my car.

He left a note on it saying he wanted to buy it and signed it with his workname
Trench. He suggested a place to meet and put in a veiled plea for privacy before
I took my trade elsewhere. I brought Fawn along to baby-sit—”

Smiley interrupted: “That was Fawn at the door just now?”

“He watched my back while we talked,” Guillam said. “I’ve kept him with us
ever since. As soon as I’d heard Tarr’s story, I rang Lacon from a call-box and
asked for an interview ... George, why don’t we talk this over among
ourselves?”

“Rang Lacon down here or in London?”

“Down here,” said Lacon.

There was a pause till Guillam explained. “I happened to remember the name
of a girl in Lacon’s office. I mentioned her name and said she had asked me to
speak to him urgently on an intimate matter. It wasn’t perfect but it was the best I
could think of on the spur of the moment.” He added, filling the silence, “Well,
damn it, there was no reason to suppose the phone was tapped.”

“There was every reason.”

Smiley had closed the passport and was examining the binding by the light of
a tattered reading lamp at his side. “This is rather good, isn’t it?” he remarked
lightly. “Really very good indeed. I’d say that was a professional product. I can’t

find a blemish.”

“Don’t worry, Mr. Smiley,” Tarr retorted, taking it back; “it’s not made in
Russia.” By the time he reached the door, his smile had returned. “You know
something?” he said, addressing all three of them down the aisle of the long
room. “If Irina is right, you boys are going to need a whole new Circus. So if we
all stick together I guess we could be in on the ground floor.” He gave the door a
playful tap. “Come on, darling, it’s me. Ricki.”

“Thank you! It’s all right now! Open up, please,” Lacon shouted, and a
moment later the key was turned, the dark figure of Fawn the baby-sitter flitted
into view, and then the footsteps faded into the big hollows of the house, to the
distant accompaniment of Jackie Lacon’s crying.
