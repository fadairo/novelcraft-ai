With mounting interest, Smiley continued his journey through Lacon’s meagre
records from that first meeting of protagonists until the present day. At the time,
such a mood of suspicion had gripped the Circus that even between Smiley and
Control the subject of Source Merlin became taboo. Alleline brought up the
Witchcraft reports and waited in the anteroom while the mothers took them to
Control, who signed them at once in order to demonstrate that he had not read
them. Alleline took back the file, poked his head round Smiley’s door, grunted a
greeting, and clumped down the staircase. Bland kept his distance, and even Bill
Haydon’s breezy visits—traditionally a part of the life up there, of the “talking
shop” that Control in the old days had liked to foster among his senior
lieutenants—became fewer and shorter, then ceased entirely.

“Control’s going potty,” Haydon told Smiley with contempt. “And if I’m not
mistaken he’s also dying. It’s just a question of which gets him first.”

The customary Tuesday meetings were discontinued, and Smiley found
himself constantly harassed by Control either to go abroad on some blurred
errand or to visit the domestic outstations—Sarratt, Brixton, Acton, and the rest
—as his personal envoy. He had a growing feeling that Control wanted him out
of the way. When they talked, he felt the heavy strain of suspicion between them,
so that even Smiley seriously wondered whether Bill was right and Control was
unfit for his job.

The Cabinet Office files made it clear that those next three months saw a
steady flowering of the Witchcraft operation, without any help from Control.
Reports came in at the rate of two or even three a month, and the standard,
according to the customers, continued excellent, but Control’s name was seldom
mentioned and he was never invited to comment. Occasionally the evaluators
produced quibbles. More often they complained that corroboration was not
possible, since Merlin took them into uncharted areas: could we not ask the
Americans to check? We could not, said the Minister. Not yet, said Alleline; who
in a confidential minute seen by no one, added, “When the time is ripe we shall
do more than barter our material for theirs. We are not interested in a one-time
deal. Our task is to establish Merlin’s track record beyond all doubt. When that is
done, Haydon can go to market...”

There was no longer any question of it. Among the chosen few who were
admitted to the chambers of the Adriatic Working Party, Merlin was already a
winner. His material was accurate; often other sources confirmed it

retrospectively. A Witchcraft committee formed, with the Minister in the chair.
Alleline was vice-chairman. Merlin had become an industry, and Control was not
even employed. Which was why in desperation he had sent out Smiley with his
beggar’s bowl: “There are three of them and Alleline,” he said. “Sweat them,
George. Tempt them, bully them, give them whatever they eat.”

Of those meetings also, the files were blessedly ignorant, for they belonged in
the worst rooms of Smiley’s memory. He had known already that there was
nothing left in Control’s larder that would satisfy their hunger.

It was April. Smiley had come back from Portugal, where he had been
burying a scandal, to find Control living under siege. Files lay strewn over the
floor; new locks had been fitted to the windows. He had put the tea-cosy over his
one telephone and from the ceiling hung a baffler against electronic
eavesdropping—a thing like an electric fan, which constantly varied its pitch. In
the three weeks Smiley had been away. Control had become an old man.

“Tell them they’re buying their way in with counterfeit money,” he ordered,
barely looking up from his files. “Tell them any damn thing. I need time.”

“There are three of them and Alleline,” Smiley now repeated to himself,
seated at the Major’s card table and studying Lacon’s list of those who had been
Witchcraft-cleared. Today there were sixty-eight licensed visitors to the Adriatic
Working Party’s reading-room. Each, like a member of the Communist Party,
was numbered according to the date of his admission. The list had been retyped
since Control’s death; Smiley was not included. But the same four founding
fathers still headed the list: Alleline, Bland, Esterhase, and Bill Haydon. Three of
them and Alleline, Control had said.

Suddenly Smiley’s mind, open as he read to every inference, every oblique
connection, was assailed by a quite extraneous vision: of himself and Ann
walking the Cornish cliffs. It was the time immediately after Control’s death, the
worst time Smiley could remember in their long, puzzled marriage. They were
high on the coast, somewhere between Eamorna and Porthcurno; they had gone
there out of season ostensibly for Ann to take the sea air for her cough. They had
been following the coast path, each lost in his thoughts: she to Haydon, he
supposed; he to Control, to Jim Prideaux and Testify, and the whole mess he had
left behind him on retirement. They shared no harmony. They had lost all
calmness in one another’s company; they were a mystery to each other, and the
most banal conversation could take strange, uncontrollable directions. In
Eondon, Ann had been living quite wildly, taking anyone who would have her.

He knew she was trying to bury something that hurt or worried her very much;
but he knew no way to reach her.

“If I had died,” she demanded suddenly, “rather than Control, say, how would

you feel towards Bill?”

Smiley was still pondering his answer when she threw in: “I sometimes think I
safeguard your opinion of him. Is that possible? That I somehow keep the two of
you together. Is that possible?”

“It’s possible.” He added, “Yes, I suppose I’m dependent on him, too, in a
way.”

“Is Bill still important in the Circus?”

“More than he was, probably.”

“And he still goes to Washington, wheels and deals with them, turns them
upside down?”

“I expect so. I hear so.”

“Is he as important as you were?”

“I suppose.”

“I suppose,” she repeated. “I expect. I hear. Is he better, then? A better
performer than you, better at the arithmetic? Tell me. Please tell me. You must.”

She was strangely excited. Her eyes, tearful from the wind, shone desperately
upon him; she had both hands on his arm and, like a child, was dragging on him
for an answer.

“You’ve always told me that men aren’t to be compared,” he replied
awkwardly. “You’ve always said you didn’t think in that category of
comparison.”

“Tell me!”

“All right: no, he’s not better.”

“As good?”

“ No.”

“And if I wasn’t there, what would you think of him then? If Bill were not my
cousin, not my anything? Tell me, would you think more of him, or less?”

“Less, I suppose.”

“Then think less now. I divorce him from the family, from our lives, from
everything. Here and now. I throw him into the sea. There. Do you understand?”

He understood only: go back to the Circus, finish your business. It was one of
a dozen ways she had of saying the same thing.

Still disturbed by this intrusion on his memory, Smiley stood up in rather a
flurry and went to the window, his habitual lookout when he was distracted. A
line of sea-gulls, a half dozen of them, had settled on the parapet. He must have
heard them calling, and remembered that walk to Lamorna.

“I cough when there are things I can’t say,” Ann had told him once. What
couldn’t she say then, he asked glumly of the chimney-pots across the street.
Connie could say it, Martindale could say it; so why couldn’t Ann?

“Three of them and Alleline,” Smiley muttered aloud. The sea-gulls had gone,
all at once, as if they had spotted a better place. “Tell them they’re buying their
way in with counterfeit money.” And if the banks accept the money? If the
experts pronounce it genuine, and Bill Haydon praises it to the skies? And the
Cabinet Office files are full of plaudits for the brave new men of Cambridge
Circus, who have finally broken the jinx?

He had chosen Esterhase first because Toby owed Smiley his career. Smiley
had recruited him in Vienna, a starving student living in the ruins of a museum
of which his dead uncle had been curator. He drove down to Acton and bearded
him at the Laundry across his walnut desk with its row of ivory telephones. On
the wall, kneeling Magi, questionable Italian seventeenth century. Through the
window, a closed courtyard crammed with cars and vans and motorbikes, and
rest-huts where the teams of lamplighters killed time between shifts. First Smiley
asked Toby about his family: there was a son who went to Westminster and a
daughter at medical school, first year. Then he put it to Toby that the
lamplighters were two months behind on their worksheets, and when Toby
hedged he asked him outright whether his boys had been doing any special jobs
recently, either at home or abroad, which for good reasons of security Toby
didn’t feel able to mention in his returns.

“Who would I do that for, George?” Toby had asked, dead-eyed. “You know
in my book that’s completely illegal.” And idiom, in Toby’s book, had a way of
being ludicrous.

“Well, I can see you doing it for Percy Alleline, for one,” Smiley suggested,
feeding him the excuse: “After all, if Percy ordered you to do something and not
to record it, you’d be in a very difficult position.”

“What sort of something, though, George, I wonder?”

“Clear a foreign letter-box, prime a safe house, watch someone’s back, spike
an embassy. Percy’s Director of Operations, after all. You might think he was
acting on instructions from the fifth floor. I can see that happening quite
reasonably.”

Toby looked carefully at Smiley. He was holding a cigarette, but apart from
lighting it he hadn’t smoked it at all. It was a hand-rolled affair, taken from a
silver box, but once lit, it never went into his mouth. It swung around, along the
line or away to the side; sometimes it was poised to take the plunge, but it never
did. Meanwhile Toby made his speech: one of Toby’s personal statements,
supposedly definitive about where he stood at this point in his life.

Toby liked the service, he said. He would prefer to remain in it. He felt
sentimental about it. He had other interests and at any time they could claim him
altogether, but he liked the service best. His trouble was, he said, promotion. Not

that he wanted it for any greedy reason. He would say his reasons were social.

“You know, George, I have so many years’ seniority I feel actually quite
embarrassed when these young fellows ask me to take orders from them. You
know what I mean? Acton, even—^just the name of Acton for them is
ridiculous.”

“Oh,” said Smiley mildly. “Which young fellows are these?”

But Esterhase had lost interest. His statement completed, his face settled again
into its familiar blank expression, his doll’s eyes fixed on a point in the middle
distance.

“Do you mean Roy Bland?” Smiley asked. “Or Percy? Is Percy young? Who,
Toby?”

It was no good, Toby regretted: “George, when you are overdue for promotion
and working your fingers to the bones, anyone looks young who’s above you on
the ladder.”

“Perhaps Gontrol could move you up a few rungs,” Smiley suggested, not
much caring for himself in this role.

Esterhase’s reply struck a chill. “Well, actually, you know, George, I am not
too sure he is able these days. Look here”—opening a drawer—“I give Ann
something. When I heard you were coming, I phone a couple of friends of mine;
something beautiful, I say, something for a faultless woman; you know I never
forget her since we met once at Bill Haydon’s cocktail?”

So Smiley carried off the consolation prize—a costly scent, smuggled, he
assumed, by one of Toby’s homing lamplighters—and took his beggar bowl to
Bland, knowing as he did so that he was coming one step nearer to Haydon.

Returning to the Major’s table, Smiley searched through Lacon’s files till he
came to a slim volume marked “Operation Witchcraft, direct subsidies,” which
recorded the earliest expenses incurred through the running of Source Merlin.
“For reasons of security it is proposed,” wrote Alleline in yet another personal
memo to the Minister, this one dated almost two years ago, “to keep the
Witchcraft financing absolutely separate from all other Gircus imprests. Until
some proper cover can be found, I am asking you for direct subventions from
Treasury funds rather than mere supplementaries to the Secret Vote, which in due
course are certain to find their way into the mainstream of Circus accounting. I
shall then account to you personally.”

“Approved,” wrote the Minister a week later, “provided always ...”

There were no provisions. A glance at the first row of figures showed Smiley
all he needed to know: already by May of that year, when that interview at Acton

took place, Toby Esterhase had personally made no fewer than eight trips on the
Witchcraft budget, two to Paris, two to The Hague, one to Helsinki, and three to
Berlin. In each case the purpose of the journey was curtly described as
“Collecting product.” Between May and November, when Control faded from
the scene, he made a further nineteen. One of these took him to Sofia, another to
Istanbul. None required him to be absent for more than three full days. Most
took place at weekends. On several such journeys, he was accompanied by
Bland.

Not to put too fine an edge on it, Toby Esterhase, as Smiley had never
seriously doubted, had lied in his teeth. It was nice to find the record confirming
his impression.

Smiley’s feelings towards Roy Bland had at that time been ambivalent.
Recalling them now, he decided they still were. A don had spotted him, Smiley
had recruited him; the combination was oddly akin to the one that had brought
Smiley himself into the Circus net. But this time there was no German monster
to fan the patriotic flame, and Smiley had always been a little embarrassed by
protestations of anti-Communism. Like Smiley, Bland had no real childhood. His
father was a docker, a passionate trade-unionist, and a Party member. His mother
died when Bland was a boy. His father hated education as he hated authority, and
when Bland grew clever the father took it into his head that he had lost his son to
the ruling class and beat the life out of him. Bland fought his way to grammar
school and in the holidays worked his fingers, as Toby would say, to the bones,
in order to raise the extra fee. When Smiley met him in his tutor’s rooms at
Oxford, he had the battered look of someone just arrived from a bad journey.

Smiley took him up, and over several months edged closer to a proposition,
which Bland accepted—largely, Smiley assumed, out of animosity towards his
father. After that he passed out of Smiley’s care. Subsisting on odd grants
undescribed. Bland toiled in the Marx Memorial Library and wrote leftish papers
for tiny magazines that would have died long ago had the Circus not subsidized
them. In the evenings he disputed loud and long at smoky meetings in pubs and
school halls. In the vacations he went to the Nursery, where a fanatic called
Thatch ran a charm school for outward-bound penetration agents, one pupil at a
time. Thatch trained Bland in tradecraft and carefully nudged his progressive
opinions nearer to his father’s Marxist camp. Three years to the day after his
recruitment, partly thanks to his proletarian pedigree, and his father’s influence
at King Street, Bland won a year’s appointment as assistant lector in economics
at the University of Poznan. He was launched.

From Poland he applied successfully for a post at the Budapest Academy of
Sciences, and for the next eight years he lived the nomadic life of a minor left-

wing intellectual in search of light, often liked but never trusted. He staged in
Prague, returned to Poland, did a hellish two semesters in Sofia and six in Kiev,
where he had a nervous breakdown, his second in as many months. Once more
the Nursery took charge of him, this time to dry him out. He was passed as clean,
his networks were given to other fieldmen, and Roy himself was brought into the
Circus to manage, mainly from a desk, the networks he had recruited in the field.
Recently, it had seemed to Smiley, Bland had become very much Haydon’s
colleague. If Smiley chanced to call on Roy for a chat, like as not Bill was
lounging in his armchair surrounded by papers, charts, and cigarette smoke; if he
dropped in on Bill, it was no surprise to find Bland, in a sweat-soaked shirt,
padding heavily back and forth across the carpet. Bill had Russia, Bland the
satellites; but already in those early days of Witchcraft, the distinction had all but
vanished.

They met at a pub in St. John’s Wood—still May—half past five on a dull day
and the garden empty. Roy brought a child, a boy of five or so, a tiny Bland, fair,
burly, and pink-faced. He didn’t explain the boy, but sometimes as they talked he
shut off and watched him where he sat on a bench away from them, eating nuts.
Nervous breakdowns or not. Bland still bore the imprimatur of the Thatch
philosophy for agents in the enemy camp: self-faith, positive participation. Pied
Piper appeal, and all those other uncomfortable phrases which in the high day of
the cold-war culture had turned the Nursery into something close to a moral-
rearmament centre.

“So what’s the deal?” Bland asked affably.

“There isn’t one really, Roy. Control feels that the present situation is
unhealthy. He doesn’t like to see you getting mixed up in a cabal. Nor do I.”

“Great. So what’s the deal?”

“What do you want?”

On the table, soaked from the earlier rain fall, was a cruet set left over from
lunchtime, with a bunch of paper-wrapped cellulose toothpicks in the centre
compartment. Taking one. Bland spat the paper onto the grass and began
working his back teeth with the fat end.

“Well, how about a five-thousand-quid backhander out the reptile fund?”

“And a house and a car?” said Smiley, making a joke of it.

“And the kid to Eton,” Bland added, and winked across the concrete paving to
the boy while he went on working with the toothpick. “I’ve paid, see, George.
You know that. I don’t know what I’ve bought with it but I’ve paid a hell of a
lot. I want some back. Ten years’ solitary for the fifth floor; that’s big money at
any age. Even yours. There must have been a reason why I fell for all that spiel,
but I can’t quite remember what it was. Must be your magnetic personality.”

Smiley’s glass was still going, so Bland fetched himself another from the bar,
and something for the boy as well.

“You’re an educated sort of swine,” he announced easily as he sat down again.
“An artist is a bloke who can hold two fundamentally opposing views and still
function: who dreamed that one up?”

“Scott Fitzgerald,” Smiley replied, thinking for a moment that Bland was
proposing to say something about Bill Haydon.

“Well, Fitzgerald knew a thing or two,” Bland affirmed. As he drank, his
bulging eyes slid sideways toward the fence, as if in search of someone. “And
I’m definitely functioning, George. As a good Socialist, I’m going for the
money. As a good capitalist. I’m sticking with the revolution, because if you
can’t beat it spy on it. Don’t look like that, George. It’s the name of the game
these days: you scratch my conscience. I’ll drive your Jag, right?” He was
already lifting an arm as he said this. “With you in a minute!” he called across
the lawn. “Set one up for me!”

Two girls were hovering on the other side of the wire fence.

“Is that Bill’s joke?” Smiley asked, suddenly quite angry.

“Is what?”

“Is that one of Bill’s jokes about materialist England, the pigs-in-clover
society?”

“Gould be,” said Bland, and finished his drink. “Don’t you like it?”

“Not too much, no. I never knew Bill before as a radical reformer. What’s
come over him all of a sudden?”

“That’s not radical,” Bland retorted, resenting any devaluation of his
Socialism, or of Haydon. “That’s just looking out the bloody window. That’s just
England now, man. Nobody wants that, do they?”

“So how do you propose,” Smiley demanded, hearing himself at his pompous
worst, “to destroy the acquisitive and competitive instincts in Western society
without also destroying...”

Bland had finished his drink; and the meeting, too. “Why should you be
bothered? You’ve got Bill’s job. What more do you want? Long as it lasts.”

And Bill’s got my wife, Smiley thought as Bland rose to go; and, damn him,
he’s told you.

The boy had invented a game. He had laid a table on its side and was rolling
an empty bottle onto the gravel. Each time, he started the bottle higher up the
table-top. Smiley left before it smashed.

Unlike Esterhase, Bland had not even bothered to lie. Lacon’s files made no
pretence of his involvement with the Witchcraft operation:

“Source Merlin,” wrote Alleline, in a minute dated soon after Control’s
departure, “is in every sense a committee operation ... I cannot honestly say
which of my three assistants deserves most praise. The energy of Bland has been
an inspiration to us all...” He was replying to the Minister’s suggestion that
those responsible for Witchcraft should be honoured in the New Year’s list.
“While Haydon’s operational ingenuity is at times little short of Merlin’s own,”
he added. The medals went to all three; Alleline’s appointment as Chief was
confirmed, and with it his beloved knighthood.
