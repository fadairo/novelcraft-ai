The describing of pain was to Jim an indulgence to be dispensed with. To
Smiley, his stoicism had something awesome about it, the more so because he
seemed unaware of it. The gaps in his story came mainly where he passed out,
he explained. The ambulance drove him, so far as he could fathom, further north.
He guessed this from the trees when they opened the door to let the doctor in: the
snow was heaviest when he looked back. The surface was good and he guessed
they were on the road to Hradec. The doctor gave him an injection; he came
round in a prison hospital with barred windows high up, and three men watching
him. He came round again after the operation, in a different cell with no
windows at all, and he thought probably the first questioning took place there,
about seventy-two hours after they’d patched him up, but time was already a
problem and of course they’d taken away his watch.

They moved him a lot. Either to different rooms, depending on what they were
going to do with him, or to other prisons, depending on who was questioning
him. Sometimes they just moved to keep him awake, walking him down cell
corridors at night. He was also moved in lorries, and once by a Czech transport
plane, but he was trussed for the flight and hooded, and passed out soon after
they took off. The interrogation which followed this flight was very long.
Otherwise he had little sense of progression from one questioning to another and
thinking didn’t get it any straighter for him—rather the reverse. The thing that
was still strongest in his memory was the plan of campaign he formed while he
waited for the first interrogation to begin. He knew silence would be impossible
and that for his own sanity, or survival, there had to be a dialogue, and at the end
of it they had to think he had told them what he knew, all he knew. Lying in
hospital, he prepared his mind into lines of defence behind which, if he was
lucky, he could fall back stage by stage until he had given the impression of total
defeat. His forward line, he reckoned, and his most expendable, was the bare
bones of Operation Testify. It was anyone’s guess whether Stevcek was a plant,
or had been betrayed. But whichever was the case, one thing was certain: the
Czechs knew more about Stevcek than Jim did. His first concession, therefore,
would be the Stevcek story, since they had it already; but he would make them
work for it. First he would deny everything and stick to his cover. After a fight,
he would admit to being a British spy and give his workname Ellis, so that if
they published it, the Circus would at least know he was alive and trying. He had
little doubt that the elaborate trap and the photographs augured a lot of ballyhoo.

After that, in accordance with his understanding with Control, he would describe
the operation as his own show, mounted without the consent of his superiors, and
calculated to win him favour. And he would bury, as deep as they could go and
deeper, all thoughts of a spy inside the Circus.

“No mole,” said Jim, to the black outlines of the Quantocks. “No meeting with
Control, no service flat in St. James’s.”

“No Tinker, Tailor.”

His second line of defence would be Max. He proposed at first to deny that he
had brought a legman at all. Then he might say he had brought one but didn’t
know his name. Then, because everyone likes a name, he would give them one:
the wrong one first, then the right one. By that time Max must be clear, or
underground, or caught.

Now came in Jim’s imagination a succession of less strongly held positions:
recent scalp-hunter operations. Circus tittle-tattle—anything to make his
interrogators think he was broken and talking free and that this was all he had,
they had passed the last trench. He would rack his memory for back scalp-hunter
cases, and if necessary he would give them the names of one or two Soviet and
satellite officials who had recently been turned or burned; of others who in the
past had made a one-time sale of assets and, since they had not defected, might
now be considered to be in line for burning or a second bite. He would throw
them any bone he could think of—sell them, if necessary, the entire Brixton
stable. And all of this would be the smokescreen to disguise what seemed to Jim
to be his most vulnerable intelligence, since they would certainly expect him to
possess it: the identity of members of the Czech end of the Aggravate and Plato
networks.

“Landkron, Krieglova, Bilova, the Pribyls,” said Jim.

Why did he choose the same order for their names? Smiley wondered.

For a long time Jim had had no responsibility for these networks. Years
earlier, before he took over Brixton, he had helped establish them, recruited
some of the founder members; since then, a lot had happened to them in the
hands of Bland and Haydon of which he knew nothing. But he was certain that
he still knew enough to blow them both sky high. And what worried him most
was the fear that Control, or Bill, or Percy Alleline, or whoever had the final say
these days, would be too greedy, or too slow, to evacuate the networks by the
time Jim, under forms of duress he could only guess at, had no alternative but to
break completely.

“So that’s the joke,” said Jim, with no humour whatever. “They couldn’t have
cared less about the networks. They asked me half a dozen questions about
Aggravate, then lost interest. They knew damn well that Testify wasn’t my

private brain-child and they knew all about Control buying the Stevcek pass in
Vienna. They began exactly where I wanted to end: with the briefing in St.
James’s. They didn’t ask me about a legman; they weren’t interested in who had
driven me to the rendezvous with the Magyar. All they wanted to talk about was
Control’s rotten-apple theory.”

One word, thought Smiley again, it might be just one word. He said, “Did they
actually know the St. James’s address?”

“They knew the brand of the bloody sherry, man.”

“And the charts?” asked Smiley quickly. “The music case?”

“No.” He added, “Not at first. No.”

Thinking inside out, Steed-Asprey used to call it. They knew because the mole
Gerald had told them, thought Smiley. The mole knew what the housekeepers
had succeeded in getting out of old MacFadean. The Circus conducts its
postmortem: Karla has the benefit of its findings in time to use them on Jim.

“So I suppose by now you were beginning to think Control was right: there
was a mole,” said Smiley.

Jim and Smiley were leaning on a wooden gate. The ground sloped sharply away
from them in a long sweep of bracken and fields. Below them lay another
village, a bay, and a thin ribbon of moonlit sea.

“They went straight to the heart of it. 'Why did Control go it alone? What did
he hope to achieve?’ 'His come-back,’ I said. So they laugh: 'With tinpot
information about military emplacements in the area of Brno? That wouldn’t
even buy him a square meal in his club.’ 'Maybe he was losing his grip,’ I said.

If Control was losing his grip, they said, who was stamping on his fingers?
Alleline, I said, that was the buzz; Alleline and Control were in competition to
provide intelligence. But in Brixton we only got the rumours, I said. 'And what
is Alleline producing that Control is not producing?’ 'I don’t know.’ 'But you
just said that Alleline and Control are in competition to provide intelligence.’

'It’s rumour. I don’t know.’ Back to the cooler.”

Time, said Jim, at this stage lost him completely. He lived either in the
darkness of the hood, or in the white light of the cells. There was no night or day,
and to make it even more weird they kept the noises going most of the time.

They were working him on the production-line principle, he explained: no
sleep, relays of questions, a lot of disorientation, a lot of muscle, till the
interrogation became to him a slow race between going a bit dotty, as he called
it, and breaking completely. Naturally, he hoped he’d go dotty but that wasn’t
something you could decide for yourself, because they had a way of bringing
you back. A lot of the muscle was done electrically.

“So we start again. New tack. 'Stevcek was an important general. If he asked
for a senior British officer, he could expect him to be properly informed about all
aspects of his career. Are you telling us you did not inform yourself?’ 'I’m
saying I got my information from Control.’ 'Did you read Stevcek’s dossier at
the Circus?’ 'No.’ 'Did Control?’ 'I don’t know.’ 'What conclusions did Control
draw from Stevcek’s second appointment in Moscow? Did Control speak to you
about Stevcek’s role in the Warsaw Pact Liaison Committee?’ 'No.’ They stuck
to that question and I suppose I stuck to my answer, because after a few more
'no’s they got a bit crazy. They seemed to lose patience. When I passed out, they
hosed me down and had another crack.”

Movement, said Jim. His narrative had become oddly jerky. Cells, corridors,
car ... at the airport V.I.P. treatment and a mauling before the aeroplane ... on
the flight, dropped off to sleep and was punished for it. “Came round in a cell
again, smaller, no paint on the walls. Sometimes I thought I was in Russia. I
worked out by the stars that we had flown east. Sometimes I was in Sarratt, back
on the interrogation resistance course.”

For a couple of days they let him alone. Head was muzzy. He kept hearing the
shooting in the forest and he saw the tattoo again, and when finally the big
session started—the one he remembered as the marathon—he had the
disadvantage of feeling half defeated when he went in.

“Matter of health, much as anything,” he explained, very tense now.

“We could take a break if you want,” Smiley said, but where Jim was, there
were no breaks, and what he wanted was irrelevant.

That was the long one, Jim said. Sometime in the course of it, he told them
about Control’s notes and his charts and the coloured inks and crayons. They
were going at him like the devil and he remembered an all-male audience, at one
end of the room, peering like a lot of damn medicos and muttering to one
another, and he told them about the crayons just to keep the talk alive, to make
them stop and listen. They listened but they didn’t stop.

“Once they had the colours, they wanted to know what the colours meant.
'What did blue mean?’ 'Control didn’t have blue.’ 'What did red mean? What
did red stand for? Give us an example of red on the chart. What did red mean?
What did red mean? What did red mean?’ Then everybody clears out except a
couple of guards and one cold little fellow, stiff back, seemed to be head boy.

The guards take me over to a table, and this little fellow sits beside me like a
bloody gnome with his hands folded. He’s got two crayons in front of him, red
and green, and a chart of Stevcek’s career.”

It wasn’t that Jim broke exactly; he just ran out of invention. He couldn’t think
up any more stories. The truths that he had locked away so deeply were the only

things that suggested themselves.

“So you told him about the rotten apple,” Smiley suggested. “And you told
him about Tinker, Tailor.”

Yes, Jim agreed, he did. He told him that Control believed Stevcek could
identify a mole inside the Circus. He told him about the Tinker, Tailor code and
who each of them was, name by name.

“What was his reaction?”

“Thought for a bit, then offered me a cigarette. Hated the damn thing.”

“Why?”

“Tasted American. Camel, one of those.”

“Did he smoke one himself?”

Jim gave a short nod. “Bloody chimney,” he said.

Time, after that, began once more to flow, said Jim. He was taken to a camp,
he guessed outside a town, and lived in a compound of huts with a double
perimeter of wire. With the help of a guard, he was soon able to walk; one day
they even went for a stroll in the forest. The camp was very big; his own
compound was only a part of it. At night he could see the glow of a city to the
east. The guards wore denims and didn’t speak, so he still had no way of telling
whether he was in Czecho or in Russia, but his money was heavily on Russia,
and when the surgeon came to take a look at his back he used a Russian-English
interpreter to express his contempt for his predecessor’s handiwork. The
interrogation continued sporadically, but without hostility. They put a fresh team
on him but it was a leisurely crowd by comparison with the first eleven. One
night he was taken to a military airport and flown by R.A.F. fighter to Inverness.
From there he went by small plane to Elstree, then by van to Sarratt; both were
night journeys.

Jim was winding up fast. He was already launched on his experiences at the
Nursery, in fact, when Smiley asked, “And the headman, the little cold one: you
never saw him again?”

Once, Jim conceded; just before he left.

“What for?”

“Gossip.” Much louder. “Eot of damned tripe about Circus personalities,
matter of fact.”

“Which personalities?”

Jim ducked that question. Tripe about who was on the up staircase, he said,
who was on the down. Who was next in line for Chief: “ 'How should I know,’ I
said. 'Bloody janitors hear it before Brixton does.’ ”

“So who came in for the tripe, precisely?”

Mainly Roy Bland, said Jim sullenly. How did Bland reconcile his left-wing

leanings with his work at the Circus? He hasn’t got any left-wing leanings, said
Jim, that’s how. What was Bland’s standing with Esterhase and Adeline? What
did Bland think of Bill’s paintings? Then how much Roy drank and what would
become of him if Bill ever withdrew his support for him? Jim gave meagre
answers to these questions.

“Was anyone else mentioned?”

“Esterhase,” Jim snapped, in the same taut tone. “Bloody man wanted to know
how anyone could trust a Hungarian.”

Smiley’s next question seemed, even to himself, to cast an absolute silence
over the whole black valley.

“And what did he say about me?” He repeated: “What did he say about me?”

“Showed me a cigarette lighter. Said it was yours. Present from Ann. 'With all
my love.’ Her signature. Engraved.”

“Did he mention how he came by it? What did he say, Jim? Come on, I’m not
going to weaken at the knees just because some Russian hood made a bad joke
about me.”

Jim’s answer came out like an army order. “He reckoned that after Bill
Haydon’s fling with her, she might care to redraft the inscription.” He swung
away towards the car. “I told him,” he shouted furiously. “Told him to his
wrinkled little face. You can’t judge Bill by things like that. Artists have totally
different standards. See things we can’t see. Feel things that are beyond us.
Bloody little man just laughed. 'Didn’t know his pictures were that good,’ he
said. I told him, George. 'Go to hell. Go to bloody hell. If you had one Bill
Haydon in your damned outfit, you could call it set and match.’ I said to him:
'Christ Almighty,’ I said, 'what are you running over here? A service or the
bloody Salvation Army?’ ”

“That was well said,” Smiley remarked at last, as if commenting on some
distant debate. “And you’d never seen him before?”

“Who?”

“The little frosty chap. He wasn’t familiar to you—from long ago, for
instance? Well, you know how we are. We’re trained, we see a lot of faces,
photographs of Centre personalities, and sometimes they stick. Even if we can’t
put a name to them any more. This one didn’t, anyway. I just wondered. It
occurred to me you had a lot of time to think,” he went on, conversationally.

“You lay there recovering, waiting to come home, and what else had you to do,
but think?” He waited. “So what did you think of, I wonder? The mission. Your
mission, I suppose.”

“Off and on.”

“With what conclusions? Anything useful? Any suspicions, insights, any hints

for me to take away?”

“Damn all, thank you,” Jim snapped, very hard. “You know me, George
Smiley. I’m not a juju man. I’m a—”

“You’re a plain fieldman who lets the other chaps do his thinking.
Nevertheless, when you know you have been led into a king-sized trap, betrayed,
shot in the back, and have nothing to do for months but lie or sit on a bunk, or
pace a Russian cell, I would guess that even the most dedicated man of
action”—his voice had lost none of its friendliness—“might put his mind to
wondering how he landed in such a scrape. Let’s take Operation Testify a
minute,” Smiley suggested to the motionless figure before him. “Testify ended
Control’s career. He was disgraced and he couldn’t pursue his mole, assuming
there was one. The Circus passed into other hands. With a sense of timeliness.
Control died. Testify did something else, too. It revealed to the Russians—
through you, actually—the exact reach of Control’s suspicions. That he’d
narrowed the field to five, but apparently no further. I’m not suggesting you
should have fathomed all that for yourself in your cell, waiting. After all, you
had no idea, sitting in the pen, that Control had been thrown out—though it
might have occurred to you that the Russians laid on that mock battle in the
forest in order to raise a wind. Did it?”

“You’ve forgotten the networks,” said Jim dully.

“Oh, the Czechs had the networks marked down long before you came on the
scene. They only rolled them up in order to compound Control’s failure.”

The discursive, almost chatty tone with which Smiley threw out these theories
found no resonance in Jim. Having waited in vain for him to volunteer some
word, Smiley let the matter drop. “Well, let’s just go over your reception at
Sarratt, shall we? To wrap it up?”

In a rare moment of forgetfulness, he helped himself to the vodka bottle
before passing it to Jim.

To judge by his voice, Jim had had enough. He spoke fast and angrily, with
that same military shortness which was his refuge from intellectual incursions.

For four days Sarratt was limbo, he said: “Ate a lot, drank a lot, slept a lot.
Walked round the cricket ground.” He’d have swum, but the pool was under
repair, as it had been six months before: damned inefficient. He had a medical,
watched television in his hut, and played a bit of chess with Cranko, who was
running reception.

Meanwhile he waited for Control to show up, but he didn’t. The first person
from the Circus to visit him was the resettlement officer, talking about a friendly
teaching agency; next came some pay wallah to discuss his pension entitlement;
then the doctor again to assess him for a gratuity. He waited for the inquisitors to

appear but they never did, which was a relief because he didn’t know what he
would have told them until he had the green light from Control and he’d had
enough of questions. He guessed Control was holding them off. It seemed mad
that he should keep from the inquisitors what he had already told the Russians
and the Czechs, but until he heard from Control, what else could he do? When
Control still sent no word, he formed notions of presenting himself to Lacon and
telling his story. Then he decided that Control was waiting for him to get clear of
the Nursery before he contacted him. He had a relapse for a few days, and when
it was over Toby Esterhase turned up in a new suit, apparently to shake him by
the hand and wish him luck. But in fact to tell him how things stood.

“Bloody odd fellow to send, but he seemed to have come up in the world.
Then I remembered what Control said about only using chaps from outstations.”

Esterhase told him that the Circus had very nearly gone under as a result of
Testify and that Jim was currently the Circus’s Number One leper. Control was
out of the game and a reorganisation was going on in order to appease Whitehall.

“Then he told me not to worry,” said Jim.

“In what way not worry?”

“About my special brief. He said a few people knew the real story, and I
needn’t worry because it was being taken care of. All the facts were known.

Then he gave me a thousand quid in cash to add to my gratuity.”

“Who from?”

“He didn’t say.”

“Did he mention Control’s theory about Stevcek? Centre’s spy inside the
Circus?”

“The facts were known,” Jim repeated, glaring. “He ordered me not to
approach anyone or try to get my story heard, because it was all being taken care
of at the highest level and anything I did might spoil the kill. The Circus was
back on the road. I could forget Tinker, Tailor and the whole damn game—
moles, everything. 'Drop out,’ he said. 'You’re a lucky man, Jim,’ he kept
saying. 'You’ve been ordered to become a lotus-eater.’ I could forget it. Right?
Forget it. Just behave as if it had never happened.” He was shouting. “And that’s
what I’ve been doing: obeying orders and forgetting!”

The night landscape seemed to Smiley suddenly innocent; it was like a great
canvas on which nothing bad or cruel had ever been painted. Side by side, they
stared down the valley over the clusters of lights to a tor raised against the
horizon. A single tower stood at its top and for a moment it marked for Smiley
the end of the journey.

“Yes,” he said. “I did a bit of forgetting, too. So Toby actually mentioned
Tinker, Tailor to you. However did he get hold of that story, unless ... And no

word from Bill?” he went on. “Not even a postcard.”

“Bill was abroad,” said Jim shortly.

“Who told you that?”

“Toby.”

“So you never saw Bill; since Testify, your oldest, closest friend, he
disappeared.”

“You heard what Toby said. I was out of bounds. Quarantine.”

“Bill was never much of a one for regulations, though, was he?” said Smiley,
in a reminiscent tone.

“And you were never one to see him straight,” Jim barked.

“Sorry I wasn’t there when you called on me, before you left for Czecho,”
Smiley remarked after a small pause. “Control had pushed me over to Germany
to get me out of the light and when I came back—what was it that you wanted,
exactly?”

“Nothing. Thought Czecho might be a bit hairy. Thought I’d give you the nod,
say goodbye.”

“Before a mission?” cried Smiley in mild surprise. “Before such a special
mission?” Jim showed no sign that he had heard. “Did you give anyone else the
nod? I suppose we were all away. Toby, Roy—Bill; did he get one?”

“No one.”

“Bill was on leave, wasn’t he? But I gather he was around, all the same.”

“No one,” Jim insisted, as a spasm of pain caused him to lift his right shoulder
and rotate his head. “All out,” he said.

“That’s very unlike you, Jim,” said Smiley in the same mild tone, “to go round
shaking hands with people before you go on vital missions. You must have been
getting sentimental in your old age. It wasn’t...” he hesitated. “It wasn’t advice
or anything that you wanted, was it? After all, you did think the mission was
poppycock, didn’t you? And that Control was losing his grip. Perhaps you felt
you should take your problem to a third party? It all had rather a mad air, I
agree.”

Learn the facts, Steed-Asprey used to say, then try on the stories like clothes.

With Jim still locked in a furious silence, they returned to the car.

At the motel Smiley drew twenty postcard-sized photographs from the recesses
of his coat and laid them out in two lines across the ceramic table. Some were
snaps, some portraits; all were of men and none of them looked English. With a
grimace Jim picked out two and handed them to Smiley. He was sure of the first,
he muttered, less sure of the second. The first was the headman, the cool little
man. The second was one of the swine who watched from the shadows while the

thugs took Jim to pieces. Smiley returned the photographs to his pocket. As he
topped up their glasses for a nightcap, a less tortured observer than Jim might
have noticed a sense not of triumph but of ceremony about him; as though the
drink were putting a seal on something.

“So when was the last time you saw Bill, actually? To talk to,” Smiley asked,
just as one might about any old friend. He had evidently disturbed Jim in other
thoughts, for he took a moment to lift his head and catch the question.

“Oh, round about,” he said carelessly. “Bumped into him in the corridors, I
suppose.”

“And to talk to? Never mind.” For Jim had returned to his other thoughts.

Jim would not be driven all the way to school. Smiley had to drop him short,
at the top of the tarmac path that led through the graveyard to the church. He had
left some workbooks in the antechapel, he said. Momentarily, Smiley felt
disposed to disbelieve him, but could not understand why. Perhaps because he
had come to the opinion that after thirty years in the trade, Jim was still a rather
poor liar. The last Smiley saw of him was that lopsided shadow striding towards
the Norman porch as his heels cracked like gunshot between the tombs.

Smiley drove to Taunton and from the Castle Hotel made a string of telephone
calls. Though exhausted, he slept fitfully between visions of Karla sitting at
Jim’s table with two crayons, and Cultural Attache Polyakov alias Viktorov, fired
by concern for the safety of his mole Gerald, waiting impatiently in the
interrogation cell for Jim to break. Lastly of Toby Esterhase bobbing into Sarratt
in place of the absent Haydon, cheerfully advising Jim to forget all about Tinker,
Tailor, and his dead inventor. Control.

The same night, Peter Guillam drove west, clean across England to Liverpool,
with Ricki Tarr as his only passenger. It was a tedious journey in beastly
conditions. For most of it, Tarr boasted about the rewards he would claim, and
the promotion, once he had carried out his mission. From there he talked about
his women: Danny, her mother, Irina. He seemed to envisage a menage a quatre
in which the two women would jointly care for Danny, and for himself.

“There’s a lot of the mother in Irina. That’s what frustrates her, naturally.”
Boris, he said, could get lost; he would tell Karla to keep him. As their
destination approached, his mood changed again and he fell silent. The dawn
was cold and foggy. In the suburbs they had to drop to a crawl and cyclists
overtook them. A reek of soot and steel filled the car.

“Don’t hang about in Dublin, either,” said Guillam suddenly. “They expect
you to work the soft routes, so keep your head down. Take the first plane out.”

“We’ve been through all that.”

“Well, Fm going through it all again,” Guillam retorted. “What’s
Mackelvore’s workname?”

“For Christ’s sake,” Tarr breathed, and gave it.

It was still dark when the Irish ferry sailed. There were soldiers and police
everywhere: this war, the last, the one before. A fierce wind was blowing off the
sea and the going looked rough. At the dockside, a sense of fellowship briefly
touched the small crowd as the ship’s lights bobbed quickly into the gloom.
Somewhere a woman was crying, somewhere a drunk was celebrating his
release.

He drove back slowly, trying to work himself out: the new Guillam who starts
at sudden noises, has nightmares, and not only can’t keep his girl but makes up
crazy reasons for distrusting her. He had challenged Camilla about Sand, and the
hours she kept, and about her secrecy in general. After listening with her grave
brown eyes fixed on him, she told him he was a fool, and left. “I am what you
think I am,” she said, and fetched her things from the bedroom. From his empty
flat he telephoned Toby Esterhase, inviting him for a friendly chat later that day.
