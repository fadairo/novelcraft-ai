“Sheer lack of will-power,” he told himself as he courteously declined the
suggestions of a lady in a doorway. “One calls it politeness, whereas in fact it is
nothing but weakness. You featherhead, Martindale. You pompous, bogus,
effeminate, nonproductive—” He stepped widely to avoid an unseen obstacle.
“Weakness,” he resumed, “and an inability to live a self-sufficient life
independent of institutions”—a puddle emptied itself neatly into his shoe—“and
emotional attachments that have long outlived their purpose. Viz., my wife; viz.,
the Circus; viz., living in London. Taxi!”

Smiley lurched forward but was already too late. Two girls, giggling under
one umbrella, clambered aboard in a flurry of arms and legs. Uselessly pulling
up the collar of his black overcoat, he continued his solitary march. “Shop-soiled
white hope,” he muttered furiously. “Little bit of sandstone in the street. You
bombastic, inquisitive, impertinent—”

And then, of course, he remembered far too late that he had left the
Grimmelshausen at his club.

“Oh, damn!” he cried sopra voce, halting in his tracks for greater emphasis.
“Oh, damn—oh, damn —oh, damn.”

He would sell his London house: he had decided. Back there under the
awning, crouching beside the cigarette machine, waiting for the cloudburst to
end, he had taken this grave decision. Property values in London had risen out of
proportion; he had heard it from every side. Good. He would sell and with a part
of the proceeds buy a cottage in the Cotswolds. Burford? Too much traffic.
Steeple Aston—that was a place. He would set up as a mild eccentric, discursive,
withdrawn, but possessing one or two lovable habits such as muttering to
himself as he bumbled along pavements. Out of date, perhaps, but who wasn’t
these days? Out of date, but loyal to his own time. At a certain moment, after all,
every man chooses: will he go forward, will he go back? There was nothing
dishonourable in not being blown about by every little modern wind. Better to
have worth, to entrench, to be an oak of one’s own generation. And if Ann
wanted to return—well, he would show her the door.

Or not show her the door, according to—well, how much she wanted to return.

Gonsoled by these visions, Smiley arrived at the King’s Road, where he
paused on the pavement as if waiting to cross. To either side, festive boutiques.
Before him, his own Bywater Street, a cul-de-sac exactly 117 of his own paces
long. When he had first come to live here, these Georgian cottages had a modest.

down-at-heel charm, with young couples making do on fifteen pounds a week
and a tax-free lodger hidden in the basement. Now steel screens protected their
lower windows, and for each house three cars jammed the curb. From long habit,
Smiley passed these in review, checking which were familiar, which were not; of
the unfamiliar, which had aerials and extra mirrors, which were the closed vans
that watchers like. Partly he did this as a test of memory to preserve his mind
from the atrophy of retirement, just as on other days he learnt the names of the
shops along his bus route to the British Museum; just as he knew how many
stairs there were to each flight of his own house and which way each of the
twelve doors opened.

But Smiley had a second reason, which was fear, the secret fear that follows
every professional to his grave. Namely, that one day, out of a past so complex
that he himself could not remember all the enemies he might have made, one of
them would find him and demand the reckoning.

At the bottom of the street, a neighbour was exercising her dog; seeing him,
she lifted her head to say something, but he ignored her, knowing it would be
about Ann. He crossed the road. His house was in darkness; the curtains were as
he had left them. He climbed the six steps to the front door. Since Ann’s
departure, his cleaning woman had also left: no one but Ann had a key. There
were two locks, a Banham deadlock and a Chubb Pipekey, and two splinters of
his own manufacture, splits of oak each the size of a thumbnail, wedged into the
lintel above and below the Banham. They were a hangover from his days in the
field. Recently, without quite knowing why, he had started using them again;
perhaps he didn’t want her to take him by surprise. With the tips of his fingers he
discovered each in turn. The routine over, he unlocked the door, pushed it open,
and felt the midday mail slithering over the carpet.

What was due? he wondered. German Life and Letters? Philology? Philology,
he decided; it was already overdue. Putting on the hall light, he stooped and
peered through his post. One “account rendered” from his tailor for a suit he had
not ordered but that he suspected was one of those presently adorning Ann’s
lover; one bill from a garage in Henley for her petrol (what, pray, were they
doing in Henley, broke, on the ninth of October?); one letter from the bank
regarding a local cashing facility in favour of the Lady Ann Smiley at a branch
of the Midland Bank in Immingham.

And what the devil, he demanded of this document, are they doing in
Immingham? Who ever had a love affair in Immingham, for goodness’ sake?
Where was Immingham?

He was still pondering the question when his gaze fell upon an unfamiliar
umbrella in the stand, a silk one with a stitched leather handle and a gold ring

with no initial. And it passed through his mind with a speed which has no place
in time that since the umbrella was dry it must have arrived there before six-
fifteen when the rain began, for there was no moisture in the stand either. Also
that it was an elegant umbrella and the ferrule was barely scratched, though it
was not new. And that therefore the umbrella belonged to someone agile—even
young, like Ann’s latest swain. But that since its owner had known about the
wedges and known how to put them back once he was inside the house, and had
the wit to lay the mail against the door after disturbing and no doubt reading it,
then most likely he knew Smiley, too; and was not a lover but a professional like
himself, who had at some time worked closely with him and knew his
handwriting, as it is called in the jargon.

The drawing-room door was ajar. Softly he pushed it further open.

“Peter?” he said.

Through the gap he saw by the light of the street two suede shoes, lazily
folded, protruding from one end of the sofa.

“I’d leave that coat on if I were you, George, old boy,” said an amiable voice.
“We’ve got a long way to go.”

Five minutes later, dressed in a vast brown travelling coat, a gift from Ann and
the only one he had that was dry, George Smiley was sitting crossly in the
passenger seat of Peter Guillam’s extremely draughty sports car, which he had
parked in an adjoining square. Their destination was Ascot, a place famous for
women and horses. And less famous, perhaps, as the residence of Mr. Oliver
Lacon, of the Gabinet Office, a senior adviser to various mixed committees and a
watchdog of intelligence affairs. Or, as Guillam had it less reverentially,
Whitehall’s head prefect.

While, at Thursgood’s school, wakefully in bed. Bill Roach was contemplating
the latest wonders that had befallen him in the course of his daily vigil over
Jim’s welfare. Yesterday Jim had amazed Latzy. Thursday he had stolen Miss
Aaronson’s mail. Miss Aaronson taught violin and scripture; Roach courted her
for her tenderness. Latzy, the assistant gardener, was a D.P., said Matron, and
D.P.s spoke no English, or very little. D.P. meant Different Person, said Matron,
or anyway, foreign from the war. But yesterday Jim had spoken to Latzy, seeking
his assistance with the car club, and he had spoken to him in D.P., or whatever
D.P.s speak, and Latzy had grown a foot taller on the spot.

The matter of Miss Aaronson’s mail was more complex. There were two
envelopes on the staffroom sideboard Thursday morning after chapel when
Roach called for his form’s exercise books, one addressed to Jim and one to
Miss Aaronson. Jim’s was typewritten. Miss Aaronson’s was handwritten, in a

hand not unlike Jim’s own. The staffroom, while Roach made these
observations, was empty. He helped himself to the exercise books and was
quietly taking his leave when Jim walked in by the other door, red and blowing
from his early walk.

“On your way, Jumbo, bell’s gone,” stooping over the sideboard.

“Yes, sir.”

“Foxy weather, eh, Jumbo?”

“Yes, sir.”

“On your way, then.”

At the door. Roach looked round. Jim was standing again, leaning back to
open the morning’s Daily Telegraph. The sideboard was empty. Both envelopes
had gone.

Had Jim written to Miss Aaronson and changed his mind? Proposing
marriage, perhaps? Another thought came to Bill Roach. Recently, Jim had
acquired an old typewriter, a wrecked Remington that he had put right with his
own hands. Had he typed his own letter on it? Was he so lonely that he wrote
himself letters, and stole other people’s as well? Roach fell asleep.
