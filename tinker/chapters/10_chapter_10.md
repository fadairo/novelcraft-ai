On another side of the house, away from the pony paddock, a grass tennis court
was hidden among the trees. It was not a good tennis court; it was mown seldom.
In spring the grass was sodden from the winter and no sun got in to dry it, in
summer the balls disappeared into the foliage, and this morning it was ankle
deep in frosted leaves that had collected from all over the garden. But round the
outside, roughly following the wire rectangle, a footpath wandered between
some beech trees and here Smiley and Lacon wandered also. Smiley had fetched
his travelling coat but Lacon wore only his threadbare suit. For this reason,
perhaps, he chose a brisk, if unco-ordinated, pace which with each stride took
him well ahead of Smiley, so that he had constantly to hover, shoulders and
elbows lifted, waiting till the shorter man caught up. Then he promptly bounded
off again, gaining ground. They completed two laps in this way before Lacon
broke the silence.

“When you came to me a year ago with a similar suggestion, Tm afraid I
threw you out. I suppose I should apologise. I was remiss.” There was a suitable
silence while he pondered his dereliction. “I instructed you to abandon your
enquiries.”

“You told me they were unconstitutional,” Smiley said mournfully, as if he
were recalling the same sad error.

“Was that the word I used? Good Lord, how very pompous of me!”

From the direction of the house came the sound of Jackie’s continued crying.

“You never had any, did you?” Lacon piped at once, his head lifted to the
sound.

“I’m sorry?”

“Children. You and Ann.”

“ No.”

“Nephews, nieces?”

“One nephew.”

“On your side?”

“Hers.”

Perhaps I never left the place, Smiley thought, peering around him at the
tangled roses, the broken swings and sodden sandpits, the raw red house so shrill
in the morning light. Perhaps we’re still here from last time.

Lacon was apologising again: “Dare I say I didn’t absolutely trust your
motives? It rather crossed my mind that Control had put you up to it, you see. As

a way of hanging on to power and keeping Alleline out”—swirling away again,
long strides, wrists outward.

“Oh, no, I assure you Control knew nothing about it at all.”

“I realise that now. I didn’t at the time. It’s a little difficult to know when to
trust you people and when not. You do live by rather different standards, don’t
you? I mean you have to. I accept that. I’m not being judgemental. Our aims are
the same, after all, even if our methods are different”—bounding over a cattle
ditch. “I once heard someone say morality was method. Do you hold with that? I
suppose you wouldn’t. You would say that morality was vested in the aim, I
expect. Difficult to know what one’s aims are, that’s the trouble, specially if
you’re British. We can’t expect you people to determine our policy for us, can
we? We can only ask you to further it. Correct? Tricky one, that.”

Rather than chase after him, Smiley sat on a rusted swing seat and huddled
himself more tightly in his coat, till finally Lacon stalked back and perched
beside him. For a while they rocked together to the rhythm of the groaning
springs.

“Why the devil did she choose Tarr?” Lacon muttered at last, fiddling his long
fingers. “Of all the people in the world to choose for a confessor, I can imagine
none more miserably unsuitable.”

“I’m afraid you’ll have to ask a woman that question, not us,” said Smiley,
wondering again where Immingham was.

“Oh, indeed,” Lacon agreed lavishly. “All that’s a complete mystery. I’m
seeing the Minister at eleven,” he confided, in a lower tone. “I have to put him in
the picture. Your parliamentary cousin,” he added, forcing an intimate joke.

“Ann’s cousin, actually,” Smiley corrected him, in the same absent tone. “Far
removed I may add, but cousin for all that.”

“And Bill Haydon is also Ann’s cousin? Our distinguished Head of London
Station.” They had played this game before as well.

“By a different route, yes. Bill is also her cousin.” He added quite uselessly:
“She comes from an old family with a strong political tradition. With time it’s
rather spread.”

“The tradition?”—Lacon loved to nail an ambiguity.

“The family.”

Beyond the trees, Smiley thought, cars are passing. Beyond the trees lies a
whole world, but Lacon has this red castle and a sense of Christian ethic that
promises him no reward except a knighthood, the respect of his peers, a fat
pension, and a couple of charitable directorships in the City.

“Anyway I’m seeing him at eleven.” Lacon had jerked to his feet and they
were walking again. Smiley caught the name “Ellis” floating backward to him

on the leafy morning air. For a moment, as in the car with Guillam, an odd
nervousness overcame him.

“After all,” Lacon was saying, “we both held perfectly honourable positions.
You felt that Ellis had been betrayed and you wanted a witch-hunt. My Minister
and I felt there had been gross incompetence on the part of Control—a view
which to put it mildly the Foreign Office shared—and we wanted a new broom.”

“Oh, I quite understood your dilemma,” said Smiley, more to himself than to
Lacon.

“Fm glad. And don’t forget, George: you were Control’s man. Control
preferred you to Haydon, and when he lost his grip towards the end—and
launched that whole extraordinary adventure—it was you who fronted for him.
No one but you, George. It’s not every day that the head of one’s secret service
embarks on a private war against the Czechs.” It was clear that the memory still
smarted. “In other circumstances, I suppose, Haydon might have gone to the
wall, but you were in the hot seat and—”

“And Percy Alleline was the Minister’s man,” said Smiley, mildly enough for
Lacon to slow himself and listen.

“It wasn’t as if you had a suspect, you know! You didn’t point the finger at
anyone! A directionless enquiry can be extraordinarily destructive!”

“Whereas a new broom sweeps cleaner.”

“Percy Alleline has produced intelligence instead of scandals, he has stuck to
the letter of his charter and won the trust of the customers. And he has not, to my
knowledge, invaded Czechoslovak territory. All in all he has done extremely
well.”

“With Bill Haydon to field for him, who wouldn’t?”

“Control, for one,” said Lacon, with punch.

They had drawn up at an empty swimming pool and now stood staring into the
deep end. From its grimy depths Smiley fancied he heard again the insinuating
tones of Roddy Martindale: “Little reading rooms at the Admiralty, little
committees popping up with funny names ...”

“Is that special source of Percy’s still running?” Smiley enquired. “The
Witchcraft material, or whatever it’s called these days?”

“I didn’t know you were on the list,” Lacon said, not at all pleased. “Since you
ask, yes. Source Merlin’s our mainstay and Witchcraft is still the name of his
product. The Circus hasn’t turned in such good material for years. Since I can
remember, in fact.”

“And still subject to all that special handling?”

“Certainly, and now that this has happened I’ve no doubt that we shall take
even more rigorous precautions.”

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Gerald might smell a rat.”

“That’s the point, isn’t it?” Lacon observed quickly. His strength was
improbable, Smiley reflected. One minute he was like a thin, drooping boxer
whose gloves were too big for his wrists; the next he had reached out and rocked
you against the ropes, and was surveying you with Christian compassion. “We
can’t move. We can’t investigate because all the instruments of enquiry are in the
Circus’s hands, perhaps in the mole Gerald’s. We can’t watch, or listen, or open
mail. To do any one of those things would require the resources of Esterhase’s
lamplighters, and Esterhase like anyone else must be suspect. We can’t
interrogate; we can’t take steps to limit a particular person’s access to delicate
secrets. To do any of these things would be to run the risk of alarming the mole.
It’s the oldest question of all, George. Who can spy on the spies? Who can smell
out the fox without running with him?” He made an awful stab at humour:

“Mole, rather,” he said, in a confiding aside.

In a fit of energy Smiley had broken away and was pounding ahead of Lacon
down the path that led towards the paddock.

“Then go to the competition,” he called. “Go to the security people. They’re
the experts; they’ll do you a job.”

“The Minister won’t have that. You know perfectly well how he and Alleline
feel about the competition. Rightly, too, if I may say so. A lot of ex-colonial
administrators ploughing through Circus papers: you might as well bring in the
army to investigate the navy!”

“That’s no comparison at all,” Smiley objected.

But Lacon as a good civil servant had his second metaphor ready: “Very well,
the Minister would rather live with a damp roof than see his castle pulled down
by outsiders. Does that satisfy you? He has a perfectly good point, George. We
do have agents in the field, and I wouldn’t give much for their chances once the
security gentlemen barge in.”

Now it was Smiley’s turn to slow down. “How many?”

“Six hundred, give or take a few.”

“And behind the Curtain?”

“We budget for a hundred and twenty.” With numbers, with facts of all sorts,
Lacon never faltered. They were the gold he worked with, wrested from the grey
bureaucratic earth. “So far as I can make out from the financial returns, almost
all of them are presently active.” He took a long bound. “So I can tell him you’ll
do it, can I?” he sang quite casually, as if the question were mere formality,
check the appropriate box. “You’ll take the job, clean the stables? Go backwards,
go forwards, do whatever is necessary? It’s your generation, after all. Your
legacy.”

Smiley had pushed open the paddock gate and slammed it behind him. They
were facing each other over its rickety frame. Lacon, slightly pink, wore a
dependent smile.

“Why do I say Ellis?” he asked conversationally. “Why do I talk about the
Ellis affair when the poor man’s name was Prideaux?”

“Ellis was his workname.”

“Of course. So many scandals in those days, one forgets the details.” Hiatus.
Swinging of the right forearm. Lunge. “And he was Haydon’s friend, not
yours?” Lacon enquired.

“They were at Oxford together before the war.”

“And stablemates in the Circus during and after. The famous Haydon-
Prideaux partnership. My predecessor spoke of it interminably.” He repeated,
“But you were never close to him?”

“To Prideaux? No.”

“Not a cousin, I mean?”

“For heaven’s sake,” Smiley breathed.

Lacon grew suddenly awkward again, but a dogged purpose kept his gaze on
Smiley. “And there’s no emotional or other reason which you feel might debar
you from the assignment? You must speak up, George,” he insisted anxiously, as
if speaking up were the last thing he wanted. He waited a fraction, then threw it
all away: “Though I see no real case. There’s always a part of us that belongs to
the public domain, isn’t there? The social contract cuts both ways; you always
knew that. I’m sure. So did Prideaux.”

“What does that mean?”

“Well, good Lord, he was shot, George. A bullet in the back is held to be quite
a sacrifice, isn’t it, even in your world?”

Alone, Smiley stood at the further end of the paddock, under the dripping
trees, trying to make sense of his emotions while he reached for breath. Like an
old illness, his anger had taken him by surprise. Ever since his retirement, he had
been denying its existence, steering clear of anything that could touch it off:
newspapers, former colleagues, gossip of the Martindale sort. After a lifetime of
living by his wits and his considerable memory, he had given himself full time to
the profession of forgetting. He had forced himself to pursue scholarly interests
which had served him well enough as a distraction while he was at the Gircus,
but which now that he was unemployed were nothing, absolutely nothing. He
could have shouted: Nothing!

“Burn the lot,” Ann had suggested helpfully, referring to his books. “Set fire
to the house. But don’t rot.”

If by rot, she meant conform, she was right to read that as his aim. He had
tried, really tried, as he approached what the insurance advertisements were
pleased to call the evening of his life, to be all that a model rentier should be;
though no one, least of all Ann, thanked him for the effort. Each morning as he
got out of bed, each evening as he went back to it, usually alone, he had
reminded himself that he never was and never had been indispensable. He had
schooled himself to admit that in those last wretched months of Control’s career,
when disasters followed one another with heady speed, he had been guilty of
seeing things out of proportion. And if the old professional Adam rebelled in
him now and then and said: You know the place went bad, you know Jim
Prideaux was betrayed—and what more eloquent testimony is there than a bullet,
two bullets, in the back? Well, he had replied, suppose he did? And suppose he
was right? “It is sheer vanity to believe that one fat middle-aged spy is the only
person capable of holding the world together,” he would tell himself. And other
times: “I never heard of anyone yet who left the Circus without some unfinished
business.”

Only Ann, though she could not read his workings, refused to accept his
findings. She was quite passionate, in fact, as only women can be on matters of
business, really driving him to go back, take up where he had left off, never to
veer aside in favour of the easy arguments. Not of course that she knew
anything, but what woman was ever stopped by a want of information? She felt.
And despised him for not acting in accordance with her feelings.

And now, at the very moment when he was near enough beginning to believe
his own dogma, a feat made no easier by Ann’s infatuation for an out-of-work
actor, what happens but that the assembled ghosts of his past—Lacon, Control,
Karla, Alleline, Esterhase, Bland, and finally Bill Haydon himself—barge into
his cell and cheerfully inform him, as they drag him back to this same garden,
that everything he had been calling vanity is truth?

“Haydon,” he repeated to himself, no longer able to stem the tides of memory.
Even the name was like a jolt. “I’m told that you and Bill shared everything once
upon a time,” said Martindale. He stared at his chubby hands, watching them
shake. Too old? Impotent? Afraid of the chase? Or afraid of what he might
unearth at the end of it? “There are always a dozen reasons for doing nothing,”
Ann liked to say—it was a favourite apologia, indeed, for many of her
misdemeanours—“There is only one reason for doing something. And that’s
because you want to.” Or have to? Ann would furiously deny it: coercion, she
would say, is just another word for doing what you want; or for not doing what
you are afraid of.

Middle children weep longer than their brothers and sisters. Over her mother’s
shoulder, stilling her pains and her injured pride, Jackie Lacon watched the party
leave. First, two men she had not seen before: one tall, one short and dark. They
drove off in a small green van. No one waved to them, she noticed, or even said
goodbye. Next, her father left in his own car; lastly a blond, good-looking man
and a short fat one in an enormous overcoat like a pony blanket made their way
to a sports car parked under the beech trees. For a moment she really thought
there must be something wrong with the fat one, he followed so slowly and so
painfully. Then, seeing the handsome man hold the car door for him, he seemed
to wake, and hurried forward with a lumpy skip. Unaccountably, this gesture
upset her afresh. A storm of sorrow seized her and her mother could not console
her.
