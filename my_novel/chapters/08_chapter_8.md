# Chapter 8

Chapter 8

The café in Brussels looked like a thousand others. Checked tablecloths, tourist menu in four languages, the smell of old grease fighting with fresh bread. Michael watched the square through glass that needed cleaning, counting the cameras he could see. Five. There would be more.

"She's late," Sophia said, not looking up from her phone.

"She's careful."

"There's a difference?"

Michael didn't answer. Across the square, a man in a hi-vis vest was checking parking meters with the kind of thoroughness that suggested he was actually checking something else. Sophia had seen him too. Her fingers moved across her phone screen, but her eyes tracked his movement.

"Contact approaching," she said quietly. "Blue scarf, leather satchel."

Lena Kovács looked exactly like her byline photo, which was either careless or confident. Dark hair pulled back, wire-rimmed glasses, the kind of severe expression that made EU bureaucrats hand over documents they shouldn't. She crossed the square without hurrying, paused at the café door like she was checking the menu, then came inside.

"Mr. Armitage. Ms. Malik." She sat without waiting for invitation, satchel placed precisely between her feet. "You've caused quite a bit of trouble in London."

"We haven't started yet," Sophia said.

Lena smiled. It wasn't a warm expression. "No, I suppose you haven't. Coffee?"

They ordered. The waitress, barely out of her teens, took their requests without writing anything down. Local place, then. Regular customers. The kind of establishment that would remember faces.

"I've been tracking Greyfriar Analytics for eighteen months," Lena said once the waitress was gone. "Started as a procurement story. EU transparency initiative, following the money, standard accountability journalism." She pulled a folder from her satchel. "Then contractors started dying."

Michael reached for the folder. Sophia's hand got there first.

"Names?" she asked, scanning the documents.

"Johan Visser, Amsterdam. Telecoms specialist. Apparent suicide, October last year. Maria Santos, Lisbon. Cyber-security consultant. Car accident, December. Two others in Berlin and Warsaw. All working on integration protocols for emergency communications systems. All raised concerns about data laundering in their final reports."

"Tom Reed stepped in front of a train six days ago," Michael said.

"I know. I was coming to London to meet him."

The coffee arrived. Three cups, dark and bitter, with the kind of crema that suggested the machine needed cleaning. They drank anyway. In places like this, refusing hospitality was remembered.

"Reed contacted me through SecureDrop," Lena continued. "Said he had evidence that Greyfriar was injecting synthetic threat assessments into official channels. Not analysis of existing intelligence, but manufactured threats designed to justify specific policy responses."

"We know," Sophia said. "We have his files."

"You have some of his files. The sanitized version left behind for whoever came looking." Lena smiled again. "Tom wasn't stupid. The real documentation is in Tangier."

Michael set down his cup harder than necessary. "Tangier?"

"He maintained a blind drop there. Old-fashioned tradecraft. Physical documents in a physical location. Said he learned from Cyprus that digital records have a way of editing themselves."

Cyprus. Even here, two years and a thousand miles away, the word still landed like an accusation. Michael felt Sophia watching him, reading his reaction with the kind of professional assessment that made him want to check for exits.

"How do we access it?" Sophia asked.

"We don't. You do." Lena slid a key across the table. Brass, worn smooth, no identifying marks. "Crédit du Maroc, Boulevard Pasteur. Safety deposit box 1247. He said Michael would know the secondary authentication."

"I don't—"

"You do. Think."

Michael picked up the key. Weight felt right for a bank box. Tom had been particular about physical security, the kind of careful that came from watching too many digital fortresses fall. What would he use? Not a password—too easy to extract. Not a document—too easy to forge. Something personal but verifiable.

"The assessment," he said quietly. "The Cyprus assessment reference number."

Lena nodded. "JIC/2022/CYP/0847. He said you'd remember. Said you couldn't forget if you tried."

She was right. The number was carved into his memory like scar tissue. The assessment that had placed a wedding party at the wrong coordinates. Seventeen dead, including children. His analysis, his recommendation, his signature on the strike authority. All justified by intelligence that, two months later, proved to have been digitally manipulated by contractors providing "confidence metrics."

"The bank will need physical presence," Lena continued. "Both of you. Tom set it up that way—two-person integrity protocol. Old Cold War rules."

"When?"

"There's a ferry from Marseille tomorrow night. Less monitored than flights. I've already booked passage under clean names." She produced two envelopes. "Everything you need. Tickets, documentation, operational funds."

Sophia opened her envelope, checking the documents with professional speed. "These are quality. Who's your forger?"

"Former Stasi document specialist. Retired to Bruges, makes identity packages for journalists who need them. Don't ask what it cost."

"Why?" Michael asked. "Why help us?"

Lena finished her coffee before answering. "Because in six months, every EU member state will be using Greyfriar's threat assessment models. Emergency procurement, justified by the rising terror index that Greyfriar itself is creating. A feedback loop of synthetic fear driving real policy. Good for business. Bad for democracy."

"Democracy's been bad for business for a while," Sophia said.

"Perhaps. But I'm a romantic. I still believe in accountable government, transparent process, the ability of citizens to question power without being labeled as threats." She paused. "Tom believed that too. It's why he's dead."

The hi-vis vest man had moved closer, now checking meters directly across from the café. Sophia had already shifted position, angling for a clear view of both exits.

"We should move," she said.

Lena shook her head. "Separately. Standard dispersion pattern. I have more to show you, but not here." She wrote an address on a napkin. "Tonight, after dark. It's a newspaper archive. I maintain research space there."

"How do we know—"

"You don't." Lena stood, collecting her satchel with the same precision she'd shown throughout. "Trust is a luxury we can't afford. But Tom said you'd come, said you'd need what he left behind. He was right about that, wasn't he?"

She dropped euros on the table and left without looking back. Professional. Clean. The kind of exit that suggested practice.

Michael pocketed the key. Its weight felt heavier than brass should.

"She's right," Sophia said. "We can't trust her."

"Tom did."

"Tom's dead."

"Which is why we're here."

They sat in silence while the café filled with lunch customers. Office workers seeking cheap calories, students stretching coffee into study space. Normal life carrying on while they planned how to steal state secrets from a dead man's African safety deposit box.

"The ferry's a bottleneck," Sophia said eventually. "If they're tracking us, that's where they'll move."

"Then we make sure they're tracking the wrong people." Michael caught the waitress's eye, gestured for the bill. "How good is your Stasi forger?"

"Good enough to fool civilian systems. Why?"

"Because we're going to need more than two sets of papers."

The newspaper archive occupied a nineteenth-century building that had survived two world wars and three economic crises. Carved stone facade, brass plaques commemorating forgotten dignitaries, the kind of institutional weight that made bureaucrats nervous. Lena met them at a side entrance, away from the security cameras that watched the main doors.

"The basement level is climate-controlled storage," she said, leading them through corridors that smelled of old paper and older secrets. "I rent space for long-term investigations. The EU transparency beat generates more documents than stories."

The room she showed them to was windowless, lined with filing cabinets and banker's boxes. A single desk held three monitors and enough encrypted hardware to make GCHQ nervous. But it was the wall that caught Michael's attention. Covered in maps, corporate structure diagrams, photos connected by colored string. The kind of analog intelligence mapping that predated digital surveillance.

"Old school," Sophia said, studying the connections.

"Harder to hack." Lena pulled a box from the nearest cabinet. "Everything I've collected on Greyfriar. Incorporation documents, contract awards, personnel files. The visible structure."

"And the invisible?"

"That's where it gets interesting." She pointed to a cluster of photos near the center of the wall. "Greyfriar Analytics, registered in London, is just the tip. The real ownership traces through shell companies in Cyprus, Malta, the Caymans. But they all loop back to a single source."

Michael stepped closer. One face appeared in multiple photos, different contexts but unmistakable. Silver hair, Savile Row suits, the kind of carefully maintained gravitas that opened doors in Whitehall.

"Sir Julian Hargreaves," Lena said. "Cabinet Office Security Transformation Envoy. Also non-executive director of six defense contractors, adviser to three intelligence software firms, and primary shareholder in the venture capital fund that owns Greyfriar's parent company."

"That's a conflict of interest," Michael said.

"That's a business model." Lena pulled out more documents. "Hargreaves positions Greyfriar to win contracts for threat assessment. Greyfriar manufactures threats to justify expanded contracts. The government authorizes emergency procurement based on Greyfriar's assessments. Every crisis becomes a revenue stream."

"The Canary Wharf exercise," Sophia said suddenly. "It's not just a capability demonstration."

"No. It's product launch." Lena found another file. "Six weeks from now, London stages the largest counter-terror exercise in UK history. Full lockdown of the financial district. Military assets deployed on civilian streets. Complete telecommunications control. All based on Greyfriar's threat assessment indicating an imminent attack."

"But if the threat is synthetic—"

"Then the exercise becomes reality. Emergency powers drafted for a simulation get implemented for real. The security apparatus Hargreaves is selling becomes permanent." She paused. "With Greyfriar providing the intelligence that justifies its own expansion. Forever."

Michael felt the weight of the key in his pocket. Whatever Tom had hidden in Tangier, it was worth killing for. Worth dying for, apparently.

"The evidence," he said. "Tom's evidence. It proves the threats are manufactured?"

"According to his last message, yes. Packet logs showing the data injection. Source code for the threat synthesis algorithms. Financial records of payments to assets who create the initial 'chatter' that Greyfriar then discovers." Lena moved to her desk, pulled up encrypted files. "But more than that. He said he had recordings."

"Of?"

"Hargreaves. In Dubai, three weeks ago. Private security investor conference. Promising that London would demonstrate, quote, 'operational readiness with full civilian compliance within the quarter.' That the new security framework would provide, quote, 'regulatory stability for decades.'"

"He was selling a police state to venture capitalists," Sophia said.

"He was selling your police state. Manufactured in Britain, tested on British citizens, then exported worldwide." Lena's expression hardened. "Every democracy gets the same package. Synthetic threats requiring real suspension of rights. All powered by Greyfriar's proprietary assessment models."

The room felt smaller suddenly. The weight of paper evidence, the careful analog connections on the wall, the patient accumulation of proof against power. Michael recognized the feeling. The moment when the scope of corruption became clear, when individual crimes revealed systemic rot. He'd felt it in Cyprus, reading the after-action reports, understanding how many people had known the intelligence was wrong and said nothing.

"Why Tangier?" Sophia asked.

"Neutral ground. Outside Five Eyes jurisdiction. Morocco has its own issues with surveillance, but they're not integrated into the Western intelligence loop. Tom maintained connections there from his Middle East posting. People who still believed in keeping secrets secret."

"And you trust his network?"

"I trust that Tom wouldn't have sent us there without reason." Lena closed the file. "The ferry leaves Marseille at 2100 tomorrow. Twelve hours to Tangier. The bank opens at 0900 local time. If we move fast—"

"They'll be waiting," Sophia interrupted. "If we've worked this out, so have they. Greyfriar will have traced Tom's connections, identified his likely drops. Tangier's too obvious."

"Which is why we're not all going to Tangier."

Michael understood immediately. "Misdirection."

"Three teams," Lena confirmed. "Clean papers for six identities. One team takes the ferry as planned. One flies to Casablanca. One drives to Gibraltar. All converging on Morocco, all leaving traces. They can't cover every approach."

"They can if they have access to Schengen movement data," Sophia said.

"They do. But that works both ways. The more they watch, the more systems they have to access. Every query leaves a trace. My friends in digital rights advocacy are very good at spotting unusual database activity." She smiled. "Sometimes transparency works in our favor."

They spent the next two hours mapping routes, memorizing legends, building operational security from habits and paranoia. Michael found himself falling back into the rhythm of it. The careful construction of believable lies. The assessment of risk versus reward. The cold calculation of acceptable losses.

"There's something else," Lena said as they prepared to leave. "Tom's final message. He said if something happened to him, I should tell you about Valetta."

Michael stopped. "Valetta?"

"Summer of 2019. Something about a missed meeting and a yellow scarf. He said you'd understand."

But Michael didn't understand. Valetta meant nothing. Summer 2019 he'd been in London, writing assessments, living the careful life of an analyst with growing doubts. No operations in Malta. No meetings missed or otherwise.

"Think about it," Lena said. "Tom was careful with his messages. Everything meant something."

They left separately again. Standard dispersion, different exits, different directions. Michael walked Brussels streets that could have been anywhere, past shops selling the same brands, cafés serving the same coffee, the homogenization of Europe proceeding one franchise at a time.

Valetta. Yellow scarf. 2019.

Not his memory. Someone else's.

He stopped walking. A memory surfaced: Tom in the Vauxhall Cross cafeteria, complaining about a blown meet in Malta. His asset had used the wrong signal, yellow instead of blue, and Tom had walked past three times before realizing the error.

"The recognition protocol," he said aloud, drawing looks from passersby.

Tom's sense of humor, even in death. The bank would need more than the Cyprus reference number. It would need the blown signal from Valetta. Yellow scarf. The kind of detail only someone who'd heard Tom tell the story would know.

His phone buzzed. Sophia: "Car in three minutes. Northwest corner."

Michael moved, checking reflections in shop windows, reading the street for surveillance. The old habits returning like muscle memory. Three days ago, he'd been filing reports nobody read, maintaining the fiction that analysis mattered to people who'd already decided what they wanted to hear. Now he was running operations in European capitals with an MI6 officer who might be under burn notice and a journalist who collected the corpses of contractors.

The car was a rental, anonymous silver that would blend anywhere. Sophia drove with professional ease, hands at ten and two, eyes checking mirrors in a pattern that never quite repeated.

"Figure it out?" she asked.


"Valetta. It's a recognition protocol."

"Good. Because I've been thinking about Tangier. Lena's right about the misdirection, but wrong about the approach. We don't need three teams. We need six."

"Budget won't—"

"Fuck the budget. I've got operational funds she doesn't know about. Emergency cache from Istanbul. We flood the zone. Make them track so many possibles they can't process them all."

"Or we make them think we're flooding the zone while we do something else entirely."

Sophia glanced at him. A smile played at the corner of her mouth, the first genuine expression he'd seen from her. "Go on."

"They expect us to be clever. Multiple routes, false trails, standard evasion. What if we're not clever? What if we're obvious?"

"Define obvious."

"Direct flight. Real names. Tourist class. Hide in plain sight among the package holidays and bachelor parties."

"That's insane."

"That's why it might work."

She considered it, taking corners with smooth precision. Brussels flowed past, a city built on bureaucracy and chocolate, where half the population worked for institutions they didn't quite believe in anymore.

"Real names are burned," she said finally. "Yours definitely, mine probably. They'll flag at passenger screening."

"Then we unburn them."

"How?"

"By making the flags disappear. Lena's friends monitor unusual database queries. What about usual ones? What about deletions that look like routine maintenance?"

Sophia's smile widened. "You want to hack Schengen."

"I want someone who already has access to make a clerical error. Remove flags that were obviously placed in error on two British citizens with clean records and no criminal history. Probably a training exercise that wasn't properly cleared. Happens all the time."

"You have someone in mind?"

"I have someone who owes me. From Cyprus. A data analyst who missed the manipulation because he was too busy manipulating other data. Small-time stuff. Expense fiddles, overtime claims. I caught him, didn't report it. Professional courtesy."

"And he'll risk his job for that courtesy?"

"He'll risk five minutes of database access to clear a debt that's been eating him for two years."

They drove in silence while Sophia processed the option. Michael watched her think, seeing the calculation play out. Risk versus reward. Trust versus paranoia. The constant mathematics of survival in their world.

"Make the call," she said finally. "But not from the car. And not from any phone we plan to keep."

They dumped the rental at Gare du Midi, took separate trains to separate internet cafés. Michael found one full of gamers and students, the kind of place where nobody looked up from their screens. He bought an hour of time with cash, opened an encrypted connection, and reached out to a man he'd helped stay out of prison.

The response came quickly. Amazing how fast guilty men moved when given a chance at redemption.

By evening, Michael Armitage and Sophia Malik were no longer persons of interest in any European security database. A clerical error, promptly corrected. The kind of minor bureaucratic adjustment that happened dozens of times daily across systems too large for any one person to monitor.

They met Lena at a hotel bar near the airport. Business travelers drowning jet lag in overpriced whiskey. She listened to their plan with the expression of someone recalculating odds.

"It's elegant," she admitted. "Also insane."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive," Sophia said.

"No, I suppose they're not." Lena raised her glass. "To Tom Reed. Who apparently taught us all different lessons about the same game."

They drank. The whiskey burned, but it was honest burning. Nothing synthetic about alcohol. It did what it promised, no more, no less.

"There's a morning flight," Michael said. "Royal Air Maroc. Direct to Tangier."

"I'll book tonight." Lena paused. "All three of us?"

"No. You stay visible here. Keep filing stories, asking questions, being the journalist they expect you to be. If they're watching you, they're not watching us."

"And when you find what Tom left?"

"We bring it back. All of it. Every document, every recording, every piece of evidence that shows what Greyfriar really is."

"And then?"

Michael met Sophia's eyes. They'd had this conversation in the car, planning for success while expecting failure.

"Then we go loud," Sophia said. "Full disclosure. Every newspaper, every platform, every system they can't control. Make it impossible to suppress."

"They'll destroy us," Lena said quietly. "All of us. The machine doesn't tolerate exposure."

"It doesn't tolerate existence either." Michael finished his drink. "Tom knew that. It's why he built insurance we could use after he was gone."

They separated again. Three different exits, three different directions, three people carrying the weight of institutional betrayal. Michael walked Brussels streets that felt like London streets that felt like nowhere in particular. Cities blending together under the weight of surveillance and standardization.

Tomorrow they'd fly to Tangier. Direct route, real names, betting their lives on the blindness of systems that saw everything but understood nothing. Tom would have appreciated the irony. Intelligence services undone by their own complexity. Threats missed because watchers watched the wrong things.

Michael found a small hotel away from the tourist districts. Paid cash, gave a name that wasn't quite false. The room was clean, anonymous, forgotten the moment he closed the door. He sat on the narrow bed and thought about Cyprus. About assessments that placed targets where targets needed to be. About seventeen dead because someone needed a success story.

Greyfriar was Cyprus scaled to industrial size. Not just false intelligence, but false reality. Synthetic threats driving real responses until the difference stopped mattering. Until security became the only story and everyone agreed to live inside it.

His phone buzzed. Sophia: "Flight confirmed. 0755 departure."

Michael deleted the message, removed the battery, dropped the pieces in separate bins on his way to buy supplies. Tomorrow they'd retrieve what Tom had died protecting. Evidence that might, possibly, slow the machinery of fear.

Or they'd die trying. Also possible. Increasingly likely.

But tonight he was alive in Brussels, walking streets that pretended normalcy while cameras tracked every step. The surveillance state was patient. It could wait. It would be there tomorrow, and the day after, and every day until someone found a way to make it stop.

Tom had tried. Now it was their turn.

Michael bought a bottle of water, a sandwich, a newspaper he wouldn't read. Props for a performance no one was watching. Or everyone was. The uncertainty was the point. Make citizens perform innocence until innocence itself became suspicious.

He thought about the key in his pocket. About vaults in Tangier holding truth that powerful men needed buried. About yellow scarves and blown meetings and the small failures that revealed larger systems.

Tomorrow they'd fly direct. No misdirection, no clever evasion. Just three people with clean names and dirty knowledge, hoping bureaucracy's left hand had forgotten what its right hand had done.

Tom would have laughed. Then he would have calculated the odds, set up secondary protocols, built insurance for the insurance. But Tom was dead, and they were alive, and that asymmetry defined everything that came next.

Michael returned to his room, set alarms he didn't trust, and tried to sleep. Brussels hummed outside his window. The white noise of a continent processing data, watching itself, building systems to manage threats it was simultaneously creating.

Somewhere in London, Sir Julian Hargreaves was planning a demonstration that would reshape British security. Somewhere in databases, algorithms were manufacturing tomorrow's crises. Somewhere in Tangier, a safety deposit box waited with evidence that might matter if anyone still cared about evidence.

The key sat heavy in Michael's pocket. Brass worn smooth by a dead man's fingers. Tom's last joke and final gift.

Tomorrow they'd find out if it was enough.
