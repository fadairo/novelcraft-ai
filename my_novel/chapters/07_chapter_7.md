# Chapter 7

Chapter 7

The safe house was a lie, like everything else in Sophia's world. Third floor of a converted warehouse in Bermondsey, sold to the neighbors as affordable housing for key workers. The kind of place gentrification hadn't quite reached, where the pubs still had sticky floors and the corner shops didn't stock quinoa.

Michael sat at a kitchen table that wobbled on uneven legs, watching Sophia work three phones simultaneously. She'd been at it for an hour, speaking in fragments that meant nothing without context.

"No, the Brussels timeline. Before the adjustment." Pause. "Check the CCTV retention period again." Pause. "That's not what I'm asking."

Through the window, London carried on its morning routine. A delivery van blocked the narrow street while someone screamed about parking regulations. Normal city friction. Nothing like the controlled panic happening in this room.

Sophia ended her last call and set the phones down in a precise row. "Your building pass expired seventeen minutes ago."

"What?"

"Revoked remotely. You're now flagged for immediate detention if you attempt entry to any government building." She opened the fridge, which contained nothing but bottled water and what looked like military ration packs. "Welcome to the other side."

Michael checked his own phone. Fourteen missed calls from departmental numbers. Three from Sarah in HR. One from a number he didn't recognize but somehow felt was important.

"They'll say I didn't show for the morning brief," he said.

"They'll say worse than that." Sophia twisted the cap off a water bottle. "Right now there's a team at your flat. Another at your gym. They'll find whatever they need to find."

"There's nothing to find."

"There's always something to find. Passport in the wrong drawer. Browser history that looks suspicious if you squint. That assessment you wrote about Cyprus—draft versions on your home system?"

Michael's stomach tightened. There were drafts. Of course there were drafts.

"How long have you been watching me?"

"Since you started asking questions about Greyfriar." She didn't apologize, didn't justify. Just stated it like weather. "You're not the first to notice the gaps. You're just the first to survive noticing."

The wobbling table suddenly felt like the only solid thing in the room. Michael gripped its edge. "Tom knew."

"Tom knew enough to get himself killed."

"They said—"

"I know what they said. Stress. Overwork. Breakdown. The same words they'll use for you if we don't move." Sophia crossed to the window, checking sightlines with practiced ease. "There's a flight to Brussels in three hours. Private charter from City Airport. New passport, new name, new reason for traveling."

"I can't just leave."

"You already have. The moment you opened that Greyfriar file, you stopped being Michael Armitage, GCH-7 analyst with a pension and a parking space. Now you're just someone who knows too much."

The phones buzzed in sequence. Sophia scanned the messages, her expression hardening with each one.

"What?"

"Your photo just hit the internal watch list." She turned the screen toward him. His security pass photo stared back, overlaid with red text: LOCATE AND DETAIN - POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH. "Usually takes them forty-eight hours to process that kind of alert. Someone's pushing hard."

Michael stood, the chair scraping against cheap linoleum. His body wanted to move but there was nowhere to go. "I need to get word to someone. Let them know I haven't—"

"Haven't what? Stolen secrets? Gone rogue? Betrayed your country?" Sophia's laugh was bitter. "The story's already written. All that matters now is whether you're around to offer a competing narrative."

"This is insane."

"This is Tuesday." She moved to a closet, pulling out a bag that looked pre-packed. "We have maybe an hour before they expand the search grid. Less if they're really worried about what you found."

Michael thought about his flat. The drafts on his laptop. The notes in his desk drawer, written in his own hand, documenting every inconsistency in the Greyfriar assessments. Evidence of exactly the kind of obsessive behavior they'd paint as paranoia or worse.

"What about Davies?" he asked.

"What about him?"

"He was in the filing room. He saw the gaps too."

Sophia zipped the bag closed with brutal efficiency. "Davies has two kids and a mortgage. He saw exactly what he needed to see."

Through the window, the delivery van had moved on. Normal service resumed. London pretending everything was fine while the machinery of state ground another body to dust.

"Brussels," Michael said. Not a question anymore.

"Lena Kovács. Investigative journalist with a special interest in defense procurement. She's been mapping Greyfriar's European contracts for months." Sophia held out a passport. The photo was his, taken from his personnel file. The name wasn't. "You're now Martin Ash, procurement consultant. Boring enough to be invisible."

Michael took the passport. Good quality forgery, but forgery nonetheless. Another line crossed. Another door closing behind him.

"What makes you think this Kovács will talk to us?"

"Because three days ago, someone tried to break into her apartment." Sophia shouldered the bag. "Professional job. Nothing taken, but her hard drives were imaged. She's smart enough to know what that means."

"And if she doesn't trust us?"

"Then we're having this conversation in much less comfortable circumstances." She moved toward the door, then paused. "Leave your phone. They'll track it."

Michael pulled out his phone. The wallpaper showed the view from Primrose Hill on a clear day. He'd taken it last summer, thinking London looked almost hopeful from that angle. He powered it down and left it on the wobbling table.

"There's something else," Sophia said. "The Canary Wharf exercise Tom was worried about. It's been moved up."

"When?"

"End of the week. Full spectrum readiness drill. They're calling it Operation Tempest."

"Christ."

"God's got nothing to do with it." She opened the door, checked the corridor with automatic caution. "This is all about proving the system works. Create the threat, demonstrate the response, justify the powers. And Greyfriar's fingerprints are all over the scenario planning."

They took the stairs down. Each floor felt like another layer of Michael's old life peeling away. By the time they reached street level, he felt weightless. Untethered.

A black cab idled outside. The driver didn't look at them as they climbed in.

"City Airport," Sophia said.

The cab pulled into traffic. Through the partition, Michael could see the driver's eyes in the mirror. Professional. Watching everything while appearing to watch nothing.

"He's one of yours?" Michael asked.

"He's one of ours now." Sophia settled back, finally allowing herself to look tired. "You need to understand something. What we're doing—it's not about saving the system. The system's already gone. We're just trying to document the collapse."

Michael thought about Tom Reed, standing on a District line platform in his sensible shoes. Had he felt this same weightlessness? This sense of institutional gravity failing?

"In Brussels," he said. "What exactly are we hoping to find?"

"Proof that Greyfriar isn't predicting threats. They're manufacturing them." Sophia watched London slide past the window. "Every assessment, every alert, every piece of classified intelligence they've provided—it's all reverse-engineered. Create the smoke, then sell the fire brigade."

"That's impossible. The verification protocols alone—"

"The verification protocols were written by Greyfriar consultants. Same people who designed the threat matrix. Same people who just happen to have the solution ready when things go critical."

The cab turned onto Commercial Road. Getting closer to the airport. Closer to the point of no return.

"How many others have tried this?" Michael asked.

"Tried what?"

"Following the thread. Pulling at the edges."

Sophia's reflection in the window looked older than her years. "Enough to establish a pattern."

They rode in silence through Poplar. Tower blocks and new developments fighting for space. London eating itself and calling it growth.

Michael's secure phone buzzed. Without thinking, he reached for it before remembering he'd left it behind. Phantom vibrations from a life already severed.

"It gets easier," Sophia said. "The disconnection. Eventually you stop reaching for things that aren't there."

"Does it?"

She didn't answer.

City Airport appeared through the drizzle. Small, efficient, designed for people who measured time in money. The cab pulled up to the private aviation entrance.

"Martin Ash flies business class," Sophia said. "He's particular about his coffee and reads the FT on his tablet. He's been to Brussels twenty-three times in the last two years. His employer is Thornfield Advisory, which exists in all the necessary databases."

"And Sophia Malik?"

"Doesn't exist at all." She handed him a boarding pass. "Your handler will meet you in the departure lounge. Red hair, reading a copy of Der Spiegel. She'll complain about the weather."

"You're not coming?"

"I have other threads to pull. Other former colleagues to extract before they make Tom's mistake." She pressed something into his hand. A phone. "Encrypted. Single-use. The only number in it is for absolute emergencies."

Michael looked at the phone, then at her. "What constitutes an absolute emergency in this context?"

"You'll know."

She opened the door. Morning drizzle hit his face, carrying the smell of jet fuel and possibility.

"Sophia. Why are you doing this?"

She considered the question with the same care she'd shown checking the window. "Because I made a mistake in Istanbul. Got the assessment wrong. People died. Good people." Her voice stayed level but something shifted behind her eyes. "The after-action report blamed bad intelligence. Faulty threat modelling from our Turkish partners. Except our Turkish partners were using Greyfriar analytics."

"So this is revenge?"

"This is correction." She nodded toward the terminal. "Better move. Martin Ash is never late."

Michael got out. The drizzle was already soaking through his jacket. Behind him, the cab door closed with finality.

By the time he turned back, it was already pulling into traffic. Sophia Malik disappearing into London's morning flow. Just another ghost in a city full of them.

The terminal doors parted automatically. Climate control and departure boards and the smell of overpriced coffee. Normal traveling life carrying on while the ground shifted beneath.

Michael Armitage walked in. Martin Ash walked out the other side.

Red hair, reading Der Spiegel. She looked up as he approached, folding the newspaper with practiced ease.

"Terrible weather," she said.

"Always is this time of year," he replied.

She smiled. "Flight's on time. Small miracles."

They walked toward security together. Two business travelers making small talk. Nothing worth remembering. Nothing worth reporting.

Behind them, London prepared for another day of managed reality. Somewhere in Vauxhall Cross, Michael's desk was being sealed. Somewhere in Canary Wharf, Operation Tempest planners refined their scenarios.

And somewhere in Brussels, Lena Kovács was discovering that her encrypted files weren't as secure as she'd believed.

The security scanner beckoned. Last chance to turn back. Last chance to call the whole thing off and throw himself on institutional mercy.

Martin Ash placed his bag on the conveyor belt and walked through.

The scanner stayed silent. Of course it did.

In this business, the real alarms never made a sound.
