# Chapter 6

Chapter 6

The first thing Michael noticed was the smell. Not coffee or photocopier toner or the persistent dampness of government carpeting, but something chemical and new. Like a server room that had been scrubbed with industrial cleaner.

Sophia Malik stood in his doorway wearing civilian clothes that didn't quite fit her. Jeans too new, jacket too structured. The uniform of someone trying to look like nobody in particular.

"Michael Armitage?"

He knew better than to answer immediately. In the basement offices of Vauxhall Cross, nobody used full names unless they were serving papers or making arrests. 

"Building security will have logged you coming down here," he said instead.

"Building security has other concerns this morning." She stepped inside without invitation, closing the door with her heel. "We need to talk about Tom Reed."

"I don't know you."

"No. But you knew him." She pulled out a phone—not the secure brick they issued for internal use, but a civilian model with the camera lens taped over. "Three days before he died, Tom tried to contact someone at Six. Multiple attempts. All blocked at the switchboard level."

Michael's hands found the edge of his desk. "How is that my concern?"

"Because the someone was me. And the something he wanted to discuss was Greyfriar Analytics."

The name hung in the air like a gas leak waiting for a spark.

"I'm just filing his papers," Michael said. "Secure storage. Nothing operational."

"Liar." She said it without heat, a professional assessment. "You found the gaps. The extractions. You've been asking questions upstairs."

"I haven't—"

"Davies. Third floor. Yesterday at 1630. You asked him about missing attachments in the Brussels procurement files." She pocketed the phone. "Would you like me to quote your exact words?"

Michael felt the familiar tightness in his chest that came with understanding you'd already lost control of a situation. "Who are you?"

"Someone who should have taken Tom's call." She moved to his water cooler, checked the empty bottle, grimaced. "How long have you been down here? Since Cyprus?"

"That's classified."

"So was the strike package you signed off on. Didn't stop it ending up in the Guardian, did it?"

The Cyprus assessment. Always the Cyprus assessment. Michael's career grave marker, carved in newsprint and parliamentary inquiries.

"Why are you here?" he asked.

"Because in about six hours, maybe less, they're going to revoke your building pass. Emergency review of access credentials. You'll get an email about system upgrades, temporary inconvenience, your understanding appreciated." She turned from the water cooler. "You won't get back in."

"That's not—"

"Check your threat board."

Michael glanced at his monitor. The internal security page that everyone kept open but nobody admitted to watching. Usually it showed travel advisories, protest warnings, the background hum of metropolitan paranoia.

Now it showed a new category: Internal Monitoring - Elevated.

"As of this morning," Sophia said, "you're flagged for 'anomalous access patterns.' That's level one. Level two is 'security review pending.' Level three—"

"Is a hold order." Michael heard his own voice from very far away. "Asset containment."

"Tom asked too many questions. Now he's dead. You're asking the same questions." She moved toward the door, paused. "Your choice. Keep filing papers until they come for your pass. Or meet me at Embankment Gardens in an hour. South side, facing the river."

"Why would I do that?"

"Because Tom wasn't supposed to die alone." She opened the door. "His handler from Six was meant to be there. Supposed to watch his back. I was running late."

The door closed. Michael stared at his monitor, at the threat board, at the words "anomalous access patterns" that might as well have been written in fire.

He pulled up the Brussels files again. Greyfriar Analytics. A name that appeared in procurement documents but never in final assessments. A company that provided "decision support services" but never specified what decisions or which support.

His building pass lay on the desk. Three years old. Photo from before Cyprus, when he still looked like someone who believed institutional loyalty ran both directions.

The secure phone rang. Internal extension.

"Armitage." He kept his voice level.

"Michael? It's Davies. Quick question about those Brussels files."

"Sir?"

"You didn't happen to make copies? For cross-reference purposes?"

Michael looked at the USB drive in his hand. When had he picked that up? "No, sir. Everything's been filed according to protocol."

"Good. Good." Davies paused. "And you'll be finishing up today?"

"Should be done by close of business."

"Actually, we've accelerated the timeline. IT needs the room for emergency maintenance. If you could wrap up by lunch?"

"Of course."

"Excellent. Oh, and Michael? Might need you to surrender your access credentials at the desk. System upgrade. You understand."

The line went dead. Michael understood perfectly.

He had fifty minutes.

The USB drive was department issue, the kind that supposedly self-wiped if removed from the building without authorization. Michael had learned in Cyprus that "supposedly" covered a lot of technical failures. He plugged it in and began copying everything with Greyfriar's name attached.

Download time: twelve minutes.

He used ten to write a resignation letter he'd never send, saved in drafts. The kind of bitter, bridge-burning text that made excellent reading for internal investigations. Let them think he was emotional, compromised, making poor decisions from anger.

The truth was worse. He was making careful decisions from clarity.

At eleven minutes, he pulled the drive and pocketed it. Deleted the transfer logs, though he knew they'd have shadow copies on the server. Didn't matter. This wasn't about hiding tracks anymore. This was about buying time.

The walk to the lobby felt longer than usual. Each security camera a small judgment. His colleagues passed without eye contact—already trained to avoid the contaminated.

"Mr. Armitage?" The desk security guard looked apologetic. Brendan. Irish. Three kids. They'd talked about football occasionally. "I'm afraid I need to collect your credentials. System maintenance."

Michael handed over his pass. "When will the new ones be ready?"

"Should be sorted by Monday. Tuesday latest."

They both knew he wouldn't be back Monday.

Outside, London carried on with its particular brand of orderly chaos. Taxis fought buses for inches of road. Tourists photographed buildings that photographed them back. The Thames ran gray as policy documents.

Embankment Gardens lay ten minutes' walk along the river. Michael took twenty, doubling back twice, using shop windows to check for surveillance that was probably there whether he spotted it or not.

Sophia sat on a bench watching the tour boats struggle against the current. Still in her civilian costume, but somehow looking more operational because of it.

"Thought you might not come," she said.

"Thought about it." He sat far enough away to suggest they weren't together. Close enough to talk. "You said Tom tried to contact you."

"Five times over three days. Used old channels, ones we'd agreed were blown after Istanbul." She didn't look at him. "I ignored them. Thought he was being sentimental."

"Tom wasn't sentimental."

"No." She watched a police boat power upstream, blue lights dark but intent obvious. "He was scared. Of Greyfriar. Of what they're doing."

"Which is?"

"I don't know. That's what Tom wanted to tell me." Now she turned. "But you have ideas."

Michael touched the USB drive in his pocket. Insurance or evidence, depending on the next few minutes. "They're writing fiction."

"Threat assessments are always fiction."

"No. We project, we analyze, we hypothesize. But we start with something real. A intercept. A asset report. Something." He watched a homeless man approach, veer away when he spotted Sophia's posture. "Greyfriar starts with nothing. They generate the threat, package it, deliver it as intelligence product."

"That's insane."

"That's profitable." Michael pulled out the drive. "Tom was building a case. Financial trails, deployment patterns, decision matrices. All pointing to manufactured crisis indicators being injected into Cabinet Office briefings."

Sophia took the drive without looking at it. Professional hands. "Why?"

"Because crisis requires response. Response requires contracts. Contracts require preferred vendors." He stood. "Speaking of response, there's a van that's been circling since I sat down. Third pass coming up."

She didn't turn. "White Transit. Two up front. Aerial suggests surveillance package."

"Yours or theirs?"

"Does it matter anymore?"

The van passed without slowing. Michael counted to ten, then twenty. "Where now?"

"Now you're burned, I'm compromised, and we're both sitting on intelligence that makes us either whistleblowers or traitors, depending on who writes the assessment." She stood, pocketed the drive. "I have a place. Off the books. We need somewhere to work."

"Work on what?"

"Staying alive long enough to matter."

They left the gardens separately. Michael went north, she went east. The van didn't follow either of them, which somehow felt worse than if it had.

The safe house wasn't safe and wasn't a house. A canal boat moored in Little Venice, the kind of floating home that tech workers bought when they couldn't afford real property. Sophia had the keys. Michael didn't ask why.

Inside, it smelled of diesel and damp and someone else's cooking. She pulled curtains that hadn't been washed since the last government.

"Tea?" she asked.

"You promised answers."

"I promised staying alive." She filled a kettle anyway. "Tom was my asset. Unofficial. We shared concerns about third-party contractors gaining direct pipeline to operational intelligence."

"Shared concerns." Michael tested the phrase. "That's what we're calling it?"

"Would you prefer 'parallel investigations outside official channels'? Or just 'treason'?"

The kettle boiled. She made tea with the automatic movements of someone who'd done too many debriefs in too many temporary spaces.

"How did he die?" Michael asked. "Really?"

"District line. Morning rush. Platform camera shows him stepping forward as the train arrived." She handed him a mug. "Clean angle. No one near him. Perfect suicide footage."

"But?"

"But Tom called me eighteen minutes before. Left a voicemail. Said he had something on Greyfriar that would, quote, 'put us all in private sector by Christmas.'" She sat across from him. "Happy people planning career changes don't typically throw themselves under trains."

Michael sipped the tea. It tasted like surveillance and budget cuts. "The Brussels files. Half of them were extracted. Professional job."

"What was left?"

"Enough to establish pattern. Greyfriar appears in preliminary assessments, never in final versions. Always as 'consultative capacity.' Never as primary contractor."

"Ghost vendor."

"With real money. Treasury traces showing seven-figure transfers. All coded as 'analytical support services.'"

Sophia pulled out a laptop Michael recognized as non-departmental. The kind you bought with cash and destroyed after use. "Tom sent me something. Night before he died. Encrypted drop, old protocol from Istanbul days."

She turned the screen toward him. Spreadsheet data, the kind that looked boring until you understood what you were seeing.

"Incident correlation," she said. "Every major security elevation in the past eighteen months. Cross-referenced with Greyfriar billing cycles."

Michael studied the patterns. "They invoice before the incidents."

"By seventy-two to ninety-six hours. Consistently."

"Could be preparation. Predictive modeling."

"Could be." She pulled up another tab. "Or they could be writing the script, then charging for the performance."

The second dataset showed communication intercepts. Not the content—that would be classified beyond even her reach. But the metadata. Origin points, relay stations, final destinations. A web of signals that looked exactly like terrorist chatter.

Except for one thing.

"These all route through the same infrastructure," Michael said.

"Very good. Gold star. And guess who owns that infrastructure?"

"Greyfriar."

"Through six shell companies and a Cayman Islands trust. But yes." She closed the laptop. "Tom figured it out. They're not predicting threats. They're manufacturing them."

"That's—"

"Impossible? Illegal? Treasonous?" Sophia laughed, short and bitter. "It's profitable. Every elevated threat level, every emergency briefing, every panic in the Cabinet Office means more contracts for security services. And who better positioned than the company already providing the intelligence?"

Michael set down his mug. His hands were steady. That surprised him. "Who else knows?"

"Tom knew. Now Tom's dead. I know. You know." She paused. "And whoever ordered your security review knows we know."

"So we take it up the chain. Internal investigation. Intelligence oversight committee."

"With what evidence? A dead man's paranoia and some extracted files?" She shook her head. "Besides, you're assuming the chain isn't already compromised."

"Then we go public. Media. Opposition briefings."

"You lasted long in government service with that kind of optimism?" She stood, moved to the window, peered through a crack in the curtains. "We need more. Financial records, communication logs, someone inside Greyfriar willing to talk."

"And if we get it?"

"Then maybe we live long enough to become the villains in someone else's assessment." She turned from the window. "Your van's back. Parked fifty meters upstream. They're not even trying to be subtle anymore."

Michael joined her at the window. White Transit, same plates. Engine running.

"Recommendations?" he asked.

"Stay here tonight. Move at first light. I have contacts in Brussels. People who've been asking similar questions about EU security contracts."

"And then?"

"Then we find out how deep this goes." She moved away from the window. "Or they find us first."

The boat rocked gently as a barge passed. Somewhere in the city, committees were meeting, assessments being written, threats being elevated or downgraded according to formulae nobody questioned.

"Why are you helping me?" Michael asked.

"Because I was late." She didn't elaborate.

He understood. In their business, being late was sometimes the only sin that mattered.

Outside, the van's engine cut off. They both heard it in the sudden silence. 

"Looks like we're past surveillance," Sophia said.

"What comes after surveillance?"

"Resolution." She moved toward a cabinet Michael hadn't noticed, pulled out two bags already packed. "Usually permanent."

The boat's door was at the stern. The bow had emergency exit to the towpath, but that would put them in open view of the van. Michael ran the geometry in his head. No good options.

"There's a third way," Sophia said, reading his calculation. "But you won't like it."

"Try me."

She opened a hatch in the floor. The smell of canal water rose like an accusation.

"Maintenance access. Leads to the next boat. Empty. For sale." She handed him one of the bags, waterproof. "Hope you can hold your breath."

Footsteps on the towpath. Multiple sets. No conversation. Professionals.

Michael looked at the black water below the hatch. Thought about Tom Reed stepping in front of the District line train. Thought about Cyprus and assessment failures and the weight of institutional betrayal.

"After you," he said.

Sophia smiled. First time he'd seen her genuinely amused. "Chivalry in the intelligence services. Tom said you were old fashioned."

She dropped through the hatch. 

Michael heard the splash, counted to three, and followed.

The water was worse than cold. It was London cold, centuries of Thames mud and diesel runoff and urban secrets. He kept his mouth shut and swam blind, following the sound of Sophia ahead.

His lungs burned. His clothes dragged. The bag on his back wanted to sink.

Then hands pulling him up through another hatch. Different boat, same smell of neglect. They lay gasping on moldy carpet while boots thundered on the deck next door.

"They'll figure it out," Sophia whispered. "Five minutes. Maybe ten."

"Then we'd better go."

They went. Up through the cabin, onto the towpath, walking like lovers out for an evening stroll. Wet clothes under stolen raincoats from the boat's closet. The bag's waterproofing had held. Small mercies.

Behind them, shouts. A splash. Someone else taking the plunge, but without consent.

"Your place or mine?" Sophia asked as they reached the street.

"Neither. Both burned by now."

"Then Brussels it is." She flagged a cab. "Hope your French is better than your swimming."

"It's not."

"Then you'll fit right in with EU bureaucracy."

The cab pulled up. Sophia gave an address in Paddington. First leg of a longer journey. Michael climbed in, London scrolling past the windows like a city he'd never properly known.

"One thing," he said as they pulled away. "Tom's daughter. Sarah. She's at university in..."

"Already covered. Watching her. Quietly." Sophia stared out her own window. "It's what Tom would have done for mine."

They rode in silence after that. Two intelligence officers without agencies, carrying stolen evidence of crimes that didn't officially exist. Tomorrow they'd be in Brussels, hunting for patterns in procurement documents.

Tonight, they were just two more people the system had decided to digest.

The cab turned north. Behind them, the canal boat burned with the kind of fire that destroyed evidence but looked accidental on incident reports. Michael watched the smoke rise in the driver's mirror until they turned a corner and it was just another London evening, full of small violences everyone agreed not to see.
