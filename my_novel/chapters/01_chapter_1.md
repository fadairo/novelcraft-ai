Chapter 1

The District line train screamed into Westminster station at 8:47 on a Tuesday morning, drowning out the announcement that would have warned Thomas Reed to stand back from the platform edge. Not that it would have mattered. Reed stepped forward with the deliberate precision of a man who had made his decision hours ago, perhaps days. The driver hit the emergency brake, but momentum is an unforgiving master. By the time the carriages stopped, Thomas Reed—former Deputy Director of Assessment at the Joint Intelligence Organisation—was already past saving.

Michael Armitage learned about his mentor's death the way he learned about most things these days: through a tersely worded email marked "Operational - Internal Only." He was halfway through his third cup of instant coffee in the basement office they'd assigned him after Cyprus, the one with no windows and a persistent smell of damp carpet. The subject line read: "Incident - Senior Staff - Action Required."

He clicked it open.

*All JIO personnel are advised that Thomas Reed (GC7, Strategic Assessment) was involved in a fatal transport incident this morning at Westminster Underground station. Initial assessment indicates personal stress factors. Grief counselling available through HR portal. Normal operations to continue.*

*M. Armitage specifically: Report to D-Branch for file transition duties, immediate effect.*

Michael read it twice, then a third time. "Personal stress factors." The phrase sat in his stomach like cold lead. Tom Reed had survived the Cold War, the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and forty years of Whitehall knife-fighting. The man who'd taught Michael how to read between the lines of CIA cables and spot the tell-tale signs of fabricated HUMINT had apparently been defeated by the 8:47 to Upminster.

The walk from his basement exile to D-Branch took twelve minutes and three security checkpoints. Each badge reader seemed to pause a fraction longer than necessary before admitting him, as if the building itself was deciding whether he still belonged. Two years ago, he'd had direct access to the seventh floor. Now, a junior security officer he didn't recognise had to escort him to the lifts.

D-Branch occupied the fourth floor's east wing, a maze of secure storage rooms and air-gapped workstations where sensitive materials went to be catalogued, redacted, or destroyed. The duty officer, a nervous man named Cartwright who perpetually looked like he was about to sneeze, met him at the security door.

"Armitage. Good, you're here." Cartwright's voice had the clipped efficiency of someone who'd been given an unpleasant task and wanted it over with. "Reed's materials need immediate review and categorisation. Standard protocol for sudden staff loss."

"Sudden staff loss." Michael kept his voice neutral. "Is that what we're calling it?"

Cartwright's left eye twitched. "That's the designated terminology, yes. His office has already been sealed. We've moved the priority materials to Secure Reading Room 3. You have until close of business Friday."

"That's three days."

"Then I suggest you start immediately."

The secure reading room was a windowless cube with yellowed fluorescent lighting and a single desk bolted to the floor. Three archive boxes waited for him, each one sealed with the red tape that meant "Eyes Only - Compartmented." Michael signed the access log and broke the first seal.

Thomas Reed had been meticulous in his record-keeping, a habit from the days when intelligence work meant carbon copies and filing cabinets rather than encrypted drives. The first box contained routine assessment reports from the past six months: Chinese naval movements in the South China Sea, Iranian proxy funding patterns, the usual dance of threats and counter-threats that kept the machinery of state spinning.

It was in the second box that Michael found the anomaly.

Tucked between a report on Turkish drone exports and an analysis of cryptocurrency use in terror financing was a folder that didn't belong. No classification marking. No distribution list. Just a handwritten label in Reed's careful script: "Greyfriar Analytics - Preliminary Concerns."

Michael opened it.

The first document was a printout of a contract tender from the Cabinet Office, dated three months ago. "Provision of Independent Threat Assessment Services - Immediate Indicators and Crisis Probability Modelling." The winning bidder: Greyfriar Analytics Ltd, registered in London with a Luxembourg parent company. Contract value: £12.4 million for the first year, with automatic renewal clauses.

The second document made Michael's coffee-acid stomach clench tighter. It was a side-by-side comparison Reed had compiled. On the left, excerpts from Greyfriar's "imminent threat indicators" that had been inserted directly into Cabinet Office security briefings. On the right, Reed's annotations in red ink:

*"Increased chatter re: Westminster transport vulnerabilities" - No corroboration from GCHQ intercepts or Five Eyes partners. Source?*

*"Credible HUMINT suggests accelerated timeline for London cell activation" - Which assets? Which handlers? No trace in our systems.*

*"Social media sentiment analysis indicates 73% probability of lone wolf incident within 7 days" - Methodology opaque. Raw data unavailable for verification.*

The third document was a draft memo, unsigned and unfinished. Reed's final paragraph read:

*The integration of private sector "threat indicators" into official intelligence products represents a critical vulnerability. Without access to sources and methods, we cannot verify the accuracy or agenda behind these assessments. More concerning is the timing correlation between Greyfriar reports and subsequent policy initiatives around enhanced security powers. Recommend immediate review of—*

The sentence ended mid-thought.

Michael photographed each page with his personal phone—a violation of every protocol he'd once sworn to uphold—then carefully replaced the documents in their folder. His hands were steady, but his mind was racing. Tom Reed hadn't been defeated by stress. He'd been digging into something, and now he was dead.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of routine files and racing thoughts. Michael catalogued and sorted with mechanical efficiency while his brain ran pattern analysis on everything he'd seen. Reed's concerns weren't paranoid speculation. The timing was too neat, the language too specific. Greyfriar wasn't just providing analysis; they were injecting narratives directly into the bloodstream of British intelligence.

At 5:30, Cartwright returned to check his progress. Michael handed over two boxes of properly sorted materials and kept his expression bored.

"Making good progress," Cartwright noted, checking items off his tablet. "The third box?"

"Still working through it. Lots of cross-references to verify."

"Remember, close of business Friday. After that, everything goes to deep archive or incineration."

"Understood."

Cartwright left, and Michael returned to the Greyfriar folder. He had two and a half days to understand what Reed had discovered and decide what to do about it. The sensible thing—the career-preserving thing—would be to file it all away and forget he'd ever seen it. That's what the Michael Armitage of two years ago would have done, before Cyprus, before a misread assessment had put a Hellfire missile through a wedding party.

But Tom Reed had stepped in front of a train rather than stay silent, and Michael owed him more than complicity.

He photocopied the key documents on the ancient Xerox machine in the corner, the one too old to have network connectivity or usage logging. The copies went into a manila envelope that he slipped inside his jacket. The originals went back in the box, properly filed and tagged for deep archive. Let them think he'd seen nothing, found nothing, suspected nothing.

The security checkpoints on the way out seemed even slower than they'd been that morning. Each badge swipe felt like an accusation. But his credentials still worked, the doors still opened, and twenty minutes later he was walking down Victoria Street in the November drizzle, the envelope burning against his ribs like a live coal.

His phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: *Drink? The Clarence, 7pm. -S*

Michael deleted the message and changed direction. The Clarence was a pub in Whitehall favoured by junior civil servants and tourists who'd gotten lost looking for Westminster Abbey. More importantly, it was loud, crowded, and had terrible mobile phone reception. Good for conversations you didn't want overheard or recorded.

He arrived at 6:45 and claimed a corner table with sightlines to both entrances. Old habits. The envelope stayed inside his jacket. At exactly 7pm, Sophia Malik walked through the door.

Michael recognised her from the Foreign Office liaison meetings before his demotion, though they'd never spoken directly. MI6 officers didn't typically socialise with JIO analysts, especially not disgraced ones. She moved through the crowd with practiced ease, a pint of bitter materialising in her hand before she slid into the seat across from him.

"Michael Armitage." She didn't phrase it as a question. "You processed Tom Reed's files today."

"News travels fast."

"In certain circles." She took a sip of her pint, dark eyes never leaving his face. "Tom was a good man. Old school. The kind who believed intelligence work meant protecting the realm, not policing opinions."

"Stress is a terrible thing," Michael said carefully.

"So is being pushed in front of a train."

The words hung between them like a loaded gun. Around them, the pub noise continued—laughter, music, the clink of glasses. Normal people living normal lives, unaware that the machinery of state had just suffered a critical fracture.

"You have no evidence of that," Michael said.

"Neither did Tom, until yesterday." Sophia leaned forward. "He reached out to me last week. Said he'd found something that didn't add up, asked if I had any back-channel contacts who could verify threat intelligence provenance. I told him I'd look into it. This morning, he's dead."

"And you think—"

"I think you found what he found. I think you're smart enough to be scared. And I think you're still idealistic enough to be angry." She finished her pint in one long swallow. "The question is: what are you going to do about it?"

Michael felt the weight of the envelope against his chest. Two paths diverged in front of him. One led back to his basement office, his quiet shame, his weekly risk assessments that no one read. The other led into the shadows where Tom Reed had died.

"Why come to me?" he asked. "Why not handle this through your own channels?"

"Because my channels are compromised. Because Tom trusted you. And because—" She stood, dropping a ten-pound note on the table. "Because in about six hours, maybe less, someone is going to notice that you photocopied classified materials in a secure reading room. When they do, your access will be revoked, your flat will be searched, and you'll be detained under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act. No lawyer, no phone call, no timeline for release."

"That's impossible. I was careful—"

"Tom was careful too." She pulled on her coat. "My advice? Don't go home tonight. Don't use your work phone. Don't trust anyone inside the building. If you're smart, you'll run. If you're brave, you'll meet me tomorrow."

She placed a business card on the table. It was blank except for an address in Bermondsey and a time: 10am.

"How do I know I can trust you?"

Sophia Malik smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. "You don't. But ask yourself this: if I wanted you disappeared, would I be warning you to run?"

She left without waiting for an answer. Michael sat for another ten minutes, nursing a pint he couldn't taste, watching the normal world carry on around him. Then he stood, dropped the manila envelope in the pub's fireplace, and walked out into the London night.

He didn't go home.

By the time the JIO's internal security unit arrived at his flat in Pimlico at 3am, Michael Armitage was already gone. What they found instead was an empty apartment, a work laptop wiped clean, and a resignation letter dated three days in the future.

The hunt for Michael Armitage, suspected intelligence leaker and potential foreign asset, began at dawn.

By then, he was already in Bermondsey, standing outside a closed coffee shop, watching the sun rise over the Thames and wondering if he'd just made the last free decision of his life.
