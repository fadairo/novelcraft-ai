# Chapter 10

Chapter 10

The safe house was a bedsit in Bermondsey that smelled of damp and the previous tenant's cooking oil. Michael checked the locks twice before setting down the evidence bag. Through the window, London looked like surveillance footage—grey light, grey buildings, grey people moving with the mechanical purpose of a city pretending everything was normal.

"Tea?" Sophia asked, already filling the kettle.

"We should keep moving."

"We should look like residents. Residents make tea."

She was right, of course. Residents made tea. Residents didn't check window angles or catalogue exit routes or notice that the van parked outside had diplomatic plates underneath the builder's merchant livery.

Michael spread the Greyfriar documents across the stained coffee table. Financial transfers, technical specifications, meeting notes in three languages. Evidence of something that shouldn't exist assembled from the filing systems of people who shouldn't have been filing it.

"This one," Sophia said, pointing to a contract annex. "Signed by Hargreaves."

"Which Hargreaves denies exists."

"Naturally."

The signature was perfect. Too perfect, perhaps—the kind of reproduction that suggested someone had practiced it. But in the basement of Vauxhall Cross, Michael had seen Tom Reed's copy of the same document with the same signature in the same blue ink.

"They're going to come for us," Sophia said, matter-of-fact as a weather report.

"They already have."

"No. That was testing. Seeing how we'd run." She poured water into mismatched mugs. "The real response comes after they've decided what kind of problem we are."

Michael knew the classifications. Disgruntled employee requiring management. Compromised asset requiring containment. Active threat requiring elimination. The bureaucracy of making people disappear had its own careful gradations.

His phone—the burner Sophia had provided—buzzed with an unknown number. They both stared at it.

"Could be Lena," Michael said.

"Could be anyone."

He answered on the fourth ring. "Yes?"

"Mr. Armitage." The voice was cultivated Home Counties, the kind that got produced in certain schools and polished in certain departments. "My name is Pemberton. I believe we should meet."

Sophia was already shaking her head, but Michael recognized the name. Pemberton ran Internal Security's Directorate of Special Inquiries—the people who investigated the investigators.

"I'm listening," Michael said.

"Are you? Because from where I sit, you appear to be doing quite the opposite." A pause, calculated for effect. "We have a mutual interest in resolving this situation without unnecessary escalation."

"By mutual interest, you mean—"

"I mean preventing good people from making irreversible mistakes. One hour. Southwark Cathedral. Come alone."

The line went dead.

"Trap," Sophia said immediately.

"Obviously."

"So we don't go."

Michael looked at the evidence spread before them. Paper and pixels that proved something monstrous was being built into the architecture of British security. Paper and pixels that would disappear the moment they were tagged as threats requiring elimination.

"We need someone inside," he said. "Someone with standing."

"Pemberton doesn't have standing. He has survival instinct."

"Sometimes that's enough."

Sophia set down her mug with excessive care. "You know what they call Pemberton in the trade?"

"The Undertaker."

"Because he buries things. Professionally. Quietly. With full ecclesiastical ceremony if required." She moved to the window, checking angles he'd already checked. "Whatever he's offering, it comes with a price."

"Everything does."

"Michael." She turned to face him, and for the first time since she'd appeared in his office, she looked tired. Not operational exhaustion but something deeper. "I've seen this before. Istanbul, Beirut, Prague. The moment when they stop trying to discredit you and start trying to recruit you back into your own silence."

"And if I don't go?"

"Then we run. Properly. New identities, new countries, new everything."

"Leaving Greyfriar operational."

"Leaving us alive."

The builder's van outside hadn't moved. Neither had the woman at the bus stop who'd been waiting for the same bus for twenty minutes. London was full of watchers watching watchers, and somewhere in that recursive loop, decisions were being made about their disposal.

"One hour," Michael said. "If I'm not back—"

"You won't be."

"If I'm not back, you take everything to Lena. Full disclosure, no edits."

Sophia's expression suggested several responses, none of them polite. "And when they pick you up at the cathedral?"

"Then you'll know what kind of problem we are."

He pocketed the burner phone and selected three documents from the pile—enough to prove he had more, not enough to matter if they were confiscated. Sophia watched him with the flat affect of someone calculating odds.

"The Tube's compromised," she said finally. "Take the bus. Change twice. Basic protocol."

"I remember the training."

"Do you remember the part about not walking into obvious traps?"

Michael paused at the door. "They found Tom on the District line platform at Westminster. Clean trajectory, they said. No hesitation."

"Your point?"

"My point is Tom never took the District line. Hated the delays. Hated the tourists." He gripped the door handle. "Sometimes the trap is not going."

The stairwell smelled of piss and ambitions that had died somewhere between the third and fourth floor. Michael descended into London's grey afternoon, knowing he was watched, knowing Sophia was right, knowing he would go anyway.

Because that's what Tom would have done.

The bus came eventually, packed with people avoiding eye contact and sharing recycled air. Michael found a seat near the back, positioning himself to watch both doors. A mother struggled with shopping bags and a pushchair. Two teenagers shared earbuds and private jokes. Normal London camouflage for abnormal purposes.

He changed buses at Elephant and Castle, doubling back on himself before heading east. Standard dry-cleaning, though he knew it was largely theatrical. If they wanted to track him, they would. The phones, the cameras, the patient accumulation of data points that added up to a life under surveillance—privacy had become a nostalgic construct, like proper tea or functional democracy.

Southwark Cathedral squatted against the Thames like a stone accusation. Michael circled it once, noting exits and the absence of obvious spotters, which meant they were using remote surveillance or had spotters he couldn't spot. Either way, he was already committed.

Pemberton sat in a rear pew, reading a book of common prayer with every appearance of genuine interest. He was younger than his reputation suggested, perhaps forty-five, with the kind of carefully maintained anonymity that took effort. Good suit, bad shoes, hair that could belong to any middle manager in any ministry.

"Mr. Armitage." He didn't look up. "Thank you for coming."

"Did I have a choice?"

"We always have choices. They're just not always good ones." Pemberton closed the prayer book, marking his place with a finger. "How much do you know about what Tom was investigating?"

"Enough."

"Doubtful. But let's pretend that's true." He gestured to the space beside him. Michael remained standing. "As you wish. I'll be brief. Your friend discovered something he shouldn't have. Now you've discovered it too. This creates a problem."

"For whom?"

"For everyone, Mr. Armitage. Despite what you might think, there are still people in the Service who believe in proper process."

"Process." Michael tasted the word. "Is that what we're calling it?"

"What would you prefer? Justice? Accountability?" Pemberton's smile belonged in a mortuary. "Those are luxury goods in a complex world."

"Greyfriar isn't complex. It's fraud."

"Greyfriar is a symptom. You're fighting symptoms."

"Then what's the disease?"

Pemberton finally looked at him directly. His eyes were the color of old pewter, and about as warm. "The disease is the belief that democracy can survive its own transparency. Do you know what happens when you show people how security really works? They panic. They vote for strongmen. They demand simplicity." He stood, smoothing his coat. "Greyfriar provides simplicity."

"Greyfriar provides lies."

"Same thing, properly packaged."

They stood facing each other in the cathedral's hush. Somewhere, a door closed. Somewhere else, tourists photographed architecture that had survived London's other catastrophes.

"What do you want?" Michael asked.

"I want you to stop. Take early retirement. Mental health grounds, given recent trauma. Full pension, clean references. We'll even throw in a commendation for your service."

"And Sophia Malik?"

"Miss Malik's situation is more complex, given her operational history. But accommodations can be made."

"And if we refuse?"

Pemberton returned to his prayer book, finding his marked page. "Then I'm afraid you'll discover that Tom Reed wasn't the only one with a weakness for the District line."

The threat landed soft as altar cloth. Michael felt his phone vibrate—Sophia, probably, wondering if he was already in a van heading for a basement interview room.

"You're afraid," Michael said.

"Of course I am. Any rational person would be." Pemberton turned a page. "The question is whether your fear serves a purpose."

"Does yours?"

"My fear keeps the lights on and the systems running. Your fear just makes you dangerous." He looked up one last time. "You have twenty-four hours to decide. After that, other departments get involved. Departments with different definitions of resolution."

Michael left him there, reading or pretending to read, a grey man in a grey suit maintaining grey equilibrium. Outside, London's afternoon had curdled into early evening. The Thames moved past, carrying the city's secrets out to sea.

The journey back took longer. Different buses, different routes, the constant low-grade paranoia of knowing that somewhere, data was being collected and conclusions drawn. He bought coffee he didn't want from a chain that didn't care, using cash that would be traced anyway.

When he finally reached the safe house, the door was already open.

Not forced. Just open.

Michael stood in the corridor, processing options. The flat was silent. No sounds of struggle, no smell of cordite, no obvious signs of violence. Just an open door and the kind of quiet that suggested careful professional work.

He entered low and fast, muscle memory from training he'd hoped never to use. The main room was empty. Documents still spread across the table, but rearranged. Photographed, probably. Catalogued for future reference.

"Sophia?"

No answer. The bedroom was empty. So was the bathroom with its moldy shower curtain and persistent leak. But the window was open, and on the sill, Sophia's phone.

Michael picked it up. The screen showed a message thread:

"Compromised. They came soft—Special Branch, not contractors. Went with them to buy time. They have questions about Istanbul. DON'T follow. DON'T negotiate. Take what we have and go to ground. -S"

The last message was a set of coordinates. Not London. Not anywhere convenient.

Michael pocketed both phones and gathered the essential documents. The rest would have been photographed anyway. Outside, the builder's van was gone, replaced by normal London traffic and the ordinary surveillance of modern life.

He had twenty-three hours to decide.

But first, he had coordinates to follow and a journalist to find.

Because Tom Reed had stepped in front of a train rather than accept the kind of offer Pemberton had just made. And Sophia Malik had let herself be taken rather than compromise their position.

The least he could do was refuse to make their sacrifices meaningless.

The evening news played on someone's television, filtered through thin walls. Another security alert. Another controlled evacuation. Another reason to be grateful for protective measures that would have seemed dystopian five years ago.

Michael shouldered the evidence bag and walked back into London's grey embrace, knowing he was watched, knowing he was marked, knowing that twenty-three hours was both too much time and not nearly enough.

But Tom had been right about one thing: the files didn't matter half as much as who was willing to read them.

And Michael was running out of readers.
