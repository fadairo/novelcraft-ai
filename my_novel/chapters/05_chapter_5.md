Chapter 5

The Brussels files made no sense.

Michael sat cross-legged on the floor of the secure filing room, surrounded by paper that told half a story. Procurement assessments that referenced attachments that didn't exist. Meeting notes that jumped from agenda item three to agenda item seven without explanation. Contract evaluations with the financial sections removed.

"Find something?" Davies asked from his corner, not looking up.

"Gaps."

"Everything has gaps. That's why we have clearance levels."

Michael held up a folder marked "Greyfriar Analytics - Preliminary Assessment." The document inside was two pages. The table of contents referenced twelve.

"These aren't classification gaps. These are extractions."

Davies set down his marking pen with the careful precision of a man choosing his words. "Tom got sloppy toward the end. Mixed his papers. Probably filed the rest somewhere else."

"Tom never mixed papers."

"Tom stepped in front of a train."

The fluorescent light above them flickered, throwing shadows that danced across the boxes. Michael returned to the Greyfriar folder. Page two ended mid-sentence: "The contractor's methodology relies on synthetic generation of—"

Of what? The next document in the box was about office supplies.

Michael's phone, surrendered at security, would have shown seventeen missed calls by now. Sarah from HR would be scheduling his grief counselling. His line manager would be drafting the memo about workload redistribution. The machine ground on.

"I need the bathroom," Michael said.

"Badge stays here."

"I'm not taking classified material to the toilet, Davies."

Davies looked up, studied Michael's face like a document requiring authentication. "Five minutes."

The fourth-floor bathroom was empty. Michael locked himself in a stall and pulled out the phone he wasn't supposed to have—the personal one, the one security didn't know about because who checks for a second phone on a junior analyst already flagged as a burnout?

Three texts from Fiona. "Heard about Tom. Are you okay?" Delete.

Two from his sister. "Mum's asking why you haven't called." Delete.

One from a number he didn't recognise. "Check your old desk. Bottom drawer."

Michael stared at the message. His old desk was in the main building, third floor, the one they'd cleared out after Cyprus. The one that should have been reassigned months ago but wasn't because who wanted to sit at the desk of the analyst who got it wrong?

He deleted the text, flushed for appearance's sake, and washed his hands like a man with nothing to hide.

Davies hadn't moved. "Find what you were looking for?"

"Prostate's not what it used to be."

"Welcome to the Service."

Michael pulled the next box toward him. Financial assessments, Yemen desk, 2023. Tom's handwriting in the margins, getting smaller and more cramped as the pages progressed. A man trying to fit too much truth into too little space.

At 16:47, Davies's phone rang. The secure line, the one that only rang for operational priorities.

"Yes?" Davies listened, his face carefully neutral. "Understood."

He hung up and began collecting his marked folders. "Change of plan. You'll need to finish this yourself."

"Everything?"

"Lock the door when you're done. Security will collect your badge on the way out."

Davies left without explanation, because explanations weren't part of the deal anymore. Michael sat alone with Tom Reed's ghost and thirty years of paper that was starting to tell a different story than the one in the official record.

He waited ten minutes, then went to the Greyfriar box.

The preliminary assessment was still two pages pretending to be twelve. But Tom had been thorough in his own way. Paper-clipped to the back cover, almost invisible unless you were looking, was a yellow sticky note with Tom's cramped writing: "Full doc in personal reference. Insurance policy."

Personal reference. Tom's habit of keeping his own copies of anything that smelled wrong. "Cover your arse, because no one else will," he'd said after Michael's first assessment went sideways, back when sideways meant a stern meeting, not exile to the basement.

Michael checked his watch. 17:03. The main building would be emptying out, the evening exodus of analysts pretending they had lives outside these walls. His old desk was fifteen minutes away if he walked fast, five if he took the tunnel.

The tunnel it was.

He packed the Greyfriar folder back in its box, careful to leave everything exactly as found. The sticky note went in his pocket. Not theft, exactly. Just translocation of administrative materials.

The connecting tunnel between buildings had been built during the Cold War, when the threat was Russian missiles rather than budget reviews. Strip lighting every ten metres, concrete walls that wept condensation, the echo of footsteps that sounded like pursuit even when you were alone.

Michael swiped his badge at three checkpoints, each reader taking longer to think about it. Still green. Still trusted. Still inside the machine.

The main building's third floor was half-dark, only every other light left on for the overnight shift. His old desk sat in the middle of the open plan, a monument to institutional indifference. Someone had left a dead potted plant on top.

Bottom drawer.

Michael knelt, feeling like a thief in his own life. The drawer was locked, but Tom had taught him that trick too—a paperclip in the right spot, a little pressure, and the cheap government locks gave up without a fight.

Inside: expense forms, old notebooks, a coffee mug that said "World's Okayest Analyst" (Secret Santa, 2019), and at the back, wrapped in a Tesco bag, a manila envelope with his initials in Tom's handwriting.

Michael took the envelope and left everything else. Let them think he was nostalgic for his old mug if anyone checked the cameras.

Back in the tunnel, walking fast but not running, never running, because running meant guilt and guilt meant questions. The envelope burned against his chest where he'd tucked it inside his jacket.

Three checkpoints back. Badge still green, but the last reader held him for eight seconds. Nine. Ten. Green.

The secure filing room was as he'd left it. Boxes waiting patiently for someone to bury their contents in the appropriate grave. Michael locked the door and sat back down in his spot, pulled out the envelope.

Inside, the full Greyfriar Analytics assessment. Twelve pages, just as the contents promised. Tom's handwriting in the margins, getting more urgent as the pages progressed.

Page three: "Contractor claims ability to predict terrorist chatter patterns using proprietary algorithms. No technical documentation provided."

Page five: "Source verification relies entirely on Greyfriar's internal authentication. No independent corroboration possible."

Page seven: "Recommend immediate suspension pending full technical audit."

Page twelve, in red ink, underlined twice: "This isn't intelligence. It's theatre."

Michael read it twice, then a third time. The hum of dying fluorescents provided a soundtrack to his growing understanding. Greyfriar Analytics wasn't just providing threat assessments to the Cabinet Office. They were providing the threats themselves. Manufacturing the chatter, creating the patterns, then selling the solution to the problem they'd created.

And Tom had known. Had documented it, filed it, sent it up the chain.

The assessment was dated three weeks ago. Tom had been dead for nine hours.

Michael's secure phone buzzed. The one they knew about. Text from Davies: "Transport waiting. Leave everything as found."

He looked at the twelve pages that explained why Tom Reed had stepped in front of a District line train. The pages that would disappear into deep archive, never to surface again. The pages that told a story about synthetic terror and real profits, about fear as a service industry.

Michael made a decision that would have disappointed his younger self, the one who believed in clean assessments.

He photographed each page with the phone they didn't know about.

Then he put Tom's assessment back in its envelope, the envelope back in his jacket, and walked to the door. Stopped. Walked back.

The two-page version, the sanitised one, the one that said nothing and concluded less—he fed it into the shredder, watching Tom's neutered words turn to confetti.

Let them think it was misfiled. Let them think Tom got sloppy. Let them think whatever helped them sleep.

Michael tucked the real assessment inside his jacket and left Room 4B for the last time. Three boxes of Tom Reed's career remained unfiled, gathering dust and secrets in equal measure. Someone else's problem now.

At security, he surrendered his badge to a guard who didn't make eye contact.

"Your building pass has been temporarily suspended pending administrative review," the guard recited. "You'll be contacted within five working days regarding reactivation procedures."

"Of course."

Outside, London's evening rain had started, turning the pavements into rivers of reflecting light. Michael stood under the concrete overhang, watching civil servants hurry toward the Underground, toward homes and families and lives that made sense.

His phone buzzed. The one they didn't know about.

Same unknown number: "Waterloo Bridge. North side. One hour."

Michael deleted the text and stepped into the rain. Somewhere beneath the city, District line trains continued their schedules, indifferent to the ghosts they carried. He thought about Tom, about that deliberate step forward, about the twelve pages that explained everything except how to live with what you knew.

One hour to Waterloo Bridge. Time enough to decide whether to show up. Time enough to realise the decision had already been made, probably the moment he'd opened that first box and found the gaps where truth used to live.

The rain soaked through his jacket, reaching the envelope underneath. The ink would be running now, Tom's urgent handwriting dissolving into illegible streams. But the photos were safe in digital memory, waiting to become evidence or accusation or both.

Michael Armitage walked toward Waterloo, just another civil servant in a city full of them, carrying secrets the machine would kill to keep buried.

Behind him, the lights in the secure building went out floor by floor, like eyes closing on a day that had seen too much.
