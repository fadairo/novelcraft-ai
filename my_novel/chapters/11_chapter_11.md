# Chapter 11

Chapter 11

The Cabinet Office secure conference room had been refurbished since Michael's last visit. New carpet, new chairs, the kind of aggressive air conditioning that made everyone slightly uncomfortable. The windows had been replaced with something that vibrated at a frequency designed to defeat laser microphones. It gave Sir Julian Hargreaves a faint shimmer, like heat distortion.

"Drink?" Hargreaves gestured at the water jug. Crystal, not the usual government-issue plastic.

"I'm fine."

"No, Mr Armitage. You're really not." Hargreaves poured himself water with the careful precision of a man who'd learned to control his hands in front of select committees. "You've been making inquiries. Brussels. Antwerp. Other places. You've been asking about Greyfriar Analytics."

Michael kept his face neutral. They knew about Brussels and Antwerp, but "other places" was fishing. Which meant they didn't have everything. Yet.

"I was concerned about anomalies in threat assessment protocols."

"Were you." Not a question. Hargreaves opened a folder—paper, not digital, which meant this conversation wouldn't exist in any system. "Thomas Reed was concerned too. Before his breakdown."

"Tom didn't have a breakdown."

"No? A man throws himself under a train, that suggests a certain... instability." Hargreaves turned a page. "You were close. Mentor and protégé. He brought you in after that business in Karachi."

The Karachi drone assessment. Three years old and still radioactive. Michael felt the familiar tightness in his chest, the weight of seventeen dead civilians compressed into a single poor judgment call.

"That was reviewed and closed."

"Reviews can be reopened. Files can be recontextualized. Amazing what looks like negligence in hindsight." Hargreaves closed the folder. "But we're not here to discuss history. We're here to discuss the future. Specifically, your future."

"My future's not your concern."

"Everything's my concern, Mr Armitage. That's what it means to be Security Transformation Envoy. Terrible title, I grant you, but the powers are really quite comprehensive." He leaned back, studying Michael with the patience of a man who'd waited out better operators than him. "We know about the journalist. Kovács. Hungarian father, British mother, tendency to see corruption where others see necessary flexibility. We know about your new friend from Six."

Michael's phone vibrated. Once. Sophia's danger signal.

"Am I under arrest?"

"Arrest?" Hargreaves looked genuinely amused. "This isn't a police state, Mr Armitage. We don't arrest people for asking questions. We simply... redirect their energies. Find them new challenges more suited to their talents."

"Like Tom?"

"Tom made his choice. You still have yours." Hargreaves stood, smoothing his tie. "There's important work coming. Work that will require good people to make hard decisions. The kind of decisions that keep the lights on and the trains running and the average citizen blissfully unaware of how close we come to the edge every single day."

"Whose edge?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Hargreaves moved to the door. "Go home, Mr Armitage. Think about what you've built. What you stand to lose. We'll be in touch."

"And if I don't?"

Hargreaves paused at the door. "Did you know that in the private sector, they call it 'scenario planning'? Much cleaner than our terminology. No talk of threat matrices or risk assessments. Just scenarios. Possibilities. Some of which become probabilities with the right... encouragement."

He left Michael alone in the humming room.

* * *

The Thames looked like hammered metal in the afternoon light. Michael walked east along the Albert Embankment, letting the October wind clear his head. Every third person looked like surveillance. Probably only half of them were.

His phone rang. Sophia.

"Clear?"

"For certain values of clear." He could hear traffic behind her voice. Moving. Good. "You got the summons too?"

"Different version. They played the Istanbul card."

"Charming."

"Where are you?"

"Westminster Bridge. Your side. The coffee stand with the Romanian kid."

Michael changed direction, doubling back through the underpass. Basic fieldcraft, probably pointless against modern surveillance, but the muscle memory helped him think. Hargreaves hadn't threatened him. Not directly. Men like Hargreaves didn't make threats. They adjusted scenarios.

The coffee stand was one of those pop-up operations that looked temporary but had somehow been there for years. Sophia sat at a picnic table, holding a paper cup like a prop. The bruise on her throat had faded to yellow.

"How much do they know?" she asked as he sat down.

"Brussels, Antwerp. Not Dubai, I think. Not yet."

"Lena?"

"On their radar. They called her a journalist, not a threat."

"Their mistake." Sophia shifted slightly, checking angles. "They're moving fast. Means we're close to something time-sensitive."

Michael thought about Hargreaves' parting words. Scenarios and probabilities. "He mentioned important work coming. Decisions that keep the trains running."

"Christ." Sophia's face went still. "The Canary Wharf exercise."

"That's not for—"

"Three days. I saw the briefing before they pulled my clearance. Full spectrum urban security exercise. Police, military, private contractors. They're calling it Crystal Shield."

"Subtle."

"They're past subtle." She pushed the coffee away untasted. "If Greyfriar's providing the threat assessment..."

"They're not assessing. They're creating."

A tourist boat passed under Westminster Bridge, its recorded commentary drifting across the water. "On your left, the Mother of Parliaments, sometimes called the Westminster System..."

"We need those Brussels files," Sophia said.

"Lena has them."

"Lena's gone dark. Has been for eighteen hours."

Michael felt the familiar chill of operations going wrong. "Dead or careful?"

"No body's turned up. Yet." Sophia stood, casual as a lunch break ending. "I've got a source in Transport Police. Says there's been chatter about expanding security powers for major infrastructure. Specifically citing 'emerging synthetic threats.'"

"Synthetic."

"Their word, not mine." She checked her phone. "My flat's burned. Yours too, probably. Where are you sleeping?"

"Bermondsey safe house."

"The one that smells like chips? Christ, standards have fallen." She started to leave, then turned back. "Michael. Whatever Tom found, whatever he was going to expose—they killed him for it. This isn't about careers anymore."

"I know."

"Do you? Because right now you look like a man still thinking he can file a report and fix this through proper channels."

She was right, of course. Part of him—the part that had spent fifteen years inside the system—still believed in oversight, accountability, the slow grinding wheels of institutional justice. Tom had believed in it too.

"What's the alternative?"

"We blow it open. Publicly. During the exercise."

"That's—"

"Treason? Terrorism? Pick your charge." Sophia's smile was all teeth. "They're going to hang us anyway. Might as well make it worth their time."

She walked away, just another civil servant heading back to the office. Michael sat for another five minutes, watching the Thames carry debris toward the sea. Then he took out his phone and did something he'd sworn he'd never do.

He called his ex-wife.

* * *

Sarah answered on the third ring. "Michael?" Her voice carried that particular mix of surprise and wariness he'd earned through two years of missed dinners and classified excuses.

"I need a favour."

"Of course you do." He could hear her office behind her—keyboards, muted conversations, the sound of actual productive work. "What kind of trouble are you in?"

"The kind I can't discuss."

"Also of course." A pause. Paper shuffling. She was nervous. "I heard about Tom. I'm sorry."

"Yeah."

"Was it... I mean, the papers said suicide."

"The papers say a lot of things."

Another pause. Longer. In the background, someone was arguing about procurement contracts. Normal problems. Solvable problems.

"What do you need, Michael?"

"Remember the cottage? Your aunt's place in Cornwall?"

"She sold it. Three years ago. You'd know that if you—" She caught herself. "Why?"

"I need somewhere quiet. Off the books. Just for a few days."

"Michael, what have you done?"

"Nothing. Yet." He watched a security camera pan across the embankment. "Sarah, I know I have no right to ask—"

"You don't."

"—but I need this. Please."

The silence stretched. He could picture her in her glass-walled office, Senior Counsel for a firm that helped tech companies navigate UK regulations. Clean work. Honest work. The life he could have had if he'd been a different kind of man.

"My cousin has a place," she said finally. "Isle of Dogs. He's in Singapore until Christmas. I've got keys."

"Sarah—"

"Don't thank me. Don't explain. Just..." Another pause. "Just be careful. Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing—Tom thought he was doing the right thing too."

She hung up. Michael deleted the call log, knowing it was already captured in a dozen systems. But some gestures mattered even when they were futile.

Especially then.

* * *

The Bermondsey safe house felt smaller in daylight. Michael spread the Greyfriar documents across the floor, building a map of connections that led from Brussels to London to places that didn't officially exist. Financial transfers routed through Cyprus and Gibraltar. Technical specifications for something called PYTHIA—Predictive Synthetic Threat Harmonization and Intelligence Amplification.

Even the acronyms were getting worse.

His laptop chimed. Encrypted message, routed through three proxies. Lena.

"Tangier. 48 hours. Bring the witch."

The witch. Meaning Sophia. Meaning Lena was either paranoid about communications security or already compromised and signaling under duress. The timestamp was six hours old.

Michael started burning documents, keeping only what would fit in a single folder. The rest went into the sink with lighter fluid. He'd learned from Tom's mistake—never leave a complete archive for them to find.

His phone rang. Unknown number.

"Mr Armitage? This is Detective Inspector Chapman, Metropolitan Police. I'm afraid there's been an incident involving a former colleague of yours. Sophia Malik?"

Michael's hand tightened on the phone. "What kind of incident?"

"Perhaps we could discuss it in person? We have a car in your area."

Of course they did. Michael looked out the window. The builder's van was gone, replaced by a Prius with government plates trying to look civilian.

"I'll come to you," he said. "Which station?"

"That won't be necessary. The car can—"

Michael hung up and threw the phone in the sink with the burning documents. The laptop followed, hard drive first. He had perhaps three minutes before they decided to stop being polite.

The back window opened onto a narrow alley that smelled of bins and disappointment. Michael dropped the eight feet badly, feeling his knees protest. Fifteen years ago, he'd have landed clean. Fifteen years ago, a lot of things were different.

He walked north, keeping to residential streets, just another middle-aged man in a suit that needed pressing. At London Bridge Station, he bought a ticket to Brighton with cash and immediately binned it. Then he caught the DLR east, riding the automated line through the bones of old docks toward an uncertain future.

Sarah's cousin's flat was on the fifteenth floor of a tower that had been luxury in 2008 and was now just expensive. Michael found the keys where she'd said, tucked behind a fire extinguisher that had been checked once and forgotten. The flat smelled of absent owner—that particular staleness of places lived in occasionally.

He checked the windows first. Good sightlines, multiple exit routes visible. The building had two stairwells and a service elevator that actually worked. Better than Bermondsey, if it came to running.

On the television, the evening news led with preparation for Crystal Shield. "London's largest integrated security exercise, designed to test response capabilities in an age of evolving threats." The Home Secretary looked grave but confident. Behind her, Michael could see private security vehicles already staging.

His burner phone—the last one—buzzed. Text from a number he didn't recognize.

"She's alive. Raven Hill, 2200. Come alone."

Raven Hill was service slang for the old Highgate Cemetery. Someone was either very clever or very stupid. Or both. Michael checked the time. Two hours to get across London without being tagged.

He left through the service elevator, wearing a hi-vis vest he'd found in a maintenance cupboard. Amazing what people didn't see when you looked like you were supposed to be there. At Canary Wharf, the security presence was already visible. Concrete barriers going up, armed police pretending to be casual. 

Crystal Shield was starting early.

* * *

Highgate Cemetery after dark was a Victorian cliché that somehow worked. Michael entered through a gap in the fence that generations of goths and security services had kept carefully unrepaired. The paths were familiar—he'd done dead drops here during training, back when the Cold War was a memory and the future threats were all supposed to come with return addresses.

He found Sophia by Marx's tomb, which was either ironic or apropos, depending on your clearance level.

"You look terrible," she said.

"You look dead. Chapman said—"

"Chapman's one of theirs. Has been for years." She stepped into better light. The bruise on her throat had been joined by others. Her left hand was splinted. "They tried to grab me at Victoria. Made a scene."

"How much of a scene?"

"Two officers in hospital, three witnesses with phone footage, and a security alert that shut down the Victoria line for twenty minutes." She smiled without humor. "Turns out I'm now wanted for suspected terrorism."

"Christ."

"Gets better. They're saying I had Syrian contacts. That Istanbul wasn't a blown operation—it was me selling out assets." She leaned against Marx's headstone. "Your friend Hargreaves is thorough."

"He's not my friend."

"No. But he knows you. Knows you'll try to fix this through channels. File reports, gather evidence, build a case." She studied him in the darkness. "That's why he let you walk out. You're predictable."

"And you're not?"

"I'm burned either way. You still think you can salvage something." She pulled out a phone—not her service one. "Lena sent a message. Tangier in thirty-six hours. She has something from the source."

"What source?"

"The one who's about to have an accident." Sophia straightened, checking angles from habit. "Michael, we can't win this playing by their rules. Crystal Shield goes live in sixty hours. Whatever they're planning, that's when it happens."

"So we run? Hide in Tangier while London—"

"While London gets a demonstration of what synthetic threats look like when they're weaponized. Yes." Her voice was flat. "Or we stay and try to stop it with no backup, no resources, and our faces on every watch list in the country."

A fox emerged from between the graves, regarded them with urban indifference, then disappeared into the shadows. London wildlife, adapted to coexistence with larger predators.

"There's a third option," Michael said.

"Enlighten me."

"We get the evidence to someone they can't dismiss. Someone public enough that killing them would raise questions."

"Who? The press thinks we're terrorists. Parliament's in recess. The security services are either compromised or paralyzed." She shook her head. "Face it, Michael. The system you believe in doesn't exist anymore. Maybe it never did."

He wanted to argue, but the words wouldn't come. Somewhere in the cemetery, a night bird called, the sound almost lost in the distant rumble of the city.

"Lena's still in play," he said finally. "If she has proof—"

"If she's still alive. If it's really her sending messages. If the proof means anything to people who've already decided what they want to believe." Sophia pushed off from the headstone. "I'm going to Tangier. You can come or you can stay and file reports until they disappear you under whatever new powers Crystal Shield justifies."

She started walking away, then paused. "That cottage Sarah offered? Might want to tell her to forget she ever mentioned it. They'll have pulled your phone records by now."

Michael watched her disappear into the maze of graves. She was right, of course. About the phone records, about the system, about everything except one thing.

He wasn't predictable. Not anymore.

Tom's death had taken care of that.

* * *

The old City Airport was mostly cargo now, passenger traffic having moved to bigger terminals as London swallowed the sky. But certain flights still left from here. Flights that didn't appear on public boards, carrying people who didn't appear in passenger manifests.

Michael had burned his last clean passport getting here. The document would work once more—to leave the country. After that, he'd be as invisible as Greyfriar's threat assessments.

Sophia was already at the gate, reading a Portuguese newspaper like a bored business traveler. She'd changed her appearance—darker hair, different walk, the kind of subtle alterations that confused facial recognition without triggering human suspicion.

"Thought you'd choose the reports," she said without looking up.

"Turns out I'm evolving."

"Evolution's overrated. Ask the dinosaurs."

Their flight was called by number, not destination. Seven passengers, none of them making eye contact. The plane was a Gulfstream that had seen better decades, configured for people who valued discretion over comfort.

As London fell away beneath them, Michael could see the Crystal Shield preparations spreading across the city like a rash. Checkpoints going up, vehicles massing in staging areas, the metropolis preparing to demonstrate how quickly freedom could be withdrawn for its own protection.

"Second thoughts?" Sophia asked.

"Third and fourth."

"Good. Means you're thinking." She closed the newspaper. "When we get to Tangier, we go dark. New names, new patterns. Everything we've been is burned."

"I know the protocol."

"Do you? Because twelve hours ago you were still trying to save the system from itself." She turned to face him. "That man needs to die in Tangier. What emerges is someone else. Someone who understands that the only way to fight a lie this big is with the truth, delivered at volume."

"Poetic."

"Practical. They've written our story for us—rogue officers, terrorist sympathies, a threat to public safety. Fine. Let's be what they say we are. Let's be the threat they need us to be."

Below them, the Channel looked like hammered steel in the moonlight. Michael thought about Tom, about seventeen dead civilians in Karachi, about all the assessments he'd written that had been transformed into policy without his consent. The system hadn't failed. It had been replaced, byte by byte, with something that looked identical but served different masters.

"What if Lena's dead?" he asked.

"Then we improvise."

"What if the source is compromised?"

"Then we run."

"What if—"

"Michael." Sophia's voice was almost gentle. "We're already dead. Everything else is just negotiating the terms."

The plane banked south, carrying them away from everything they'd sworn to protect. In three days, Crystal Shield would show London what security looked like when private companies wrote the threat assessments. 

In three days, they'd either stop it or become the evidence that justified it.

Michael closed his eyes and tried not to think about which was more likely.
