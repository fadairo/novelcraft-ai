# Chapter 9

Chapter 9

The Eurostar chunked its way through Kent darkness while Michael tried to make sense of Lena's procurement data on a laptop that kept losing battery. Opposite him, Sophia dozed with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd learned to sleep in hostile territory. Her hand stayed close to the bag containing their only evidence that Greyfriar existed as more than a paper entity.

"Antwerp," Lena had said twelve hours earlier. "Their technical operations run through Antwerp."

Now she was in the wind with her own copy of the files, and they were heading back to London with targets on their backs the size of dinner plates.

The businessman across the aisle had been reading the same newspaper page for twenty minutes. Michael catalogued the tell-tale signs: shoes too good for his cheap suit, the way he held his coffee cup without drinking, the slight bulge at his ankle that wasn't quite a medical brace.

"How many?" Sophia asked without opening her eyes.

"Just the one."

"Optimist."

She was right. The woman two rows back with the romance novel. The teenager with expensive headphones who hadn't touched his phone in an hour. Even the attendant who'd checked their tickets three times.

"They're not trying to hide," Michael said.

"No. They want us to know we're blown." Sophia sat up, alert now. "Question is whether they move before we reach St Pancras."

The train began its descent into the tunnel. Michael's ears popped. In the sudden darkness of the windows, he caught the businessman's reflection shifting position.

"Pack up," Sophia said quietly.

Michael closed the laptop and slipped it into his bag. The Tangier drive went into his inside pocket. The weight of it felt heavier than physics could explain.

The businessman stood up and moved toward the toilet. The woman with the romance novel turned a page she hadn't read. The teenager finally looked at his phone, thumb moving in the practiced rhythm of someone sending a situation report.

"Next carriage," Sophia said. "Slowly."

They stood together, Michael reaching for nonexistent luggage in the overhead rack while Sophia stretched like someone working out travel stiffness. Normal passengers doing normal things, except for the way they moved in synchronization, covering angles without seeming to.

The connecting door hissed open. The next carriage was fuller, morning commuters and budget travelers who'd caught the dawn service. Better cover, worse sightlines. Sophia led them toward the far end, past a French family arguing over breakfast and a group of students who'd clearly been drinking since Brussels.

"Mademoiselle?" A new attendant appeared in their path, uniform perfect, smile professional. "Your tickets, please?"

They'd already been checked. Four times.

"Of course." Sophia's hand moved toward her pocket, then accelerated into something else entirely. The attendant stepped back, hands rising, but she was already past him, pushing Michael forward as shouts erupted behind them.

The businessman from their original carriage appeared at the far door, no longer pretending to read. The bulge at his ankle had migrated to his hand.

"Move," Sophia said unnecessarily.

They pushed through into the next carriage as the train began its climb back toward daylight. The Channel behind them, England ahead, and nowhere to run in between.

"Next one's first class," Michael said.

"Good. Fewer witnesses."

The first-class carriage was nearly empty. A businessman tapping at a laptop, an elderly couple sharing tea, two seats that had been recently vacated judging by the still-warm cups on the table.

"Kitchen car," Sophia said. "Then the driver's cab."

"That's a dead end."

"Everything's a dead end on a train."

Behind them, the connecting door opened. Not the businessman this time, but the teenager with the headphones, moving with the kind of casual purpose that meant training. His hand stayed low, holding something that wasn't quite a phone.

Sophia turned to face him while pushing Michael forward. "Go."

"Not leaving you."

"Not asking."

The kitchen car smelled of reheated croissants and industrial coffee. A server looked up from the preparation counter, about to speak, then saw their faces and stepped aside. Smart man.

The train lurched slightly, the track curve that meant they were ten minutes from St Pancras. Ten minutes from whatever reception committee was waiting. Ten minutes to figure out how to stay free with evidence that could collapse Hargreaves' entire operation.

The connecting door burst open. Sophia backed through, her left arm hanging at an angle that suggested the teenager had known his business. Blood ran from a cut above her eye.

"Change of plan," she said.

Michael pulled her behind the serving counter as the door opened again. This time it was the woman with the romance novel, except she wasn't holding a book anymore.

"Kitchen exit," Sophia breathed. "Emergency release."

"At this speed?"

"Better than a black site cell."

The emergency door was marked with warnings in three languages about prosecution for improper use. Michael wondered if that would be the least of their charges when this was over.

The woman raised her weapon. Not quite a gun, something more specialized. Sophia pushed Michael toward the door while rolling in the opposite direction, drawing attention and fire.

The window beside Michael's head starred but didn't shatter. Electroshock rounds, then. They wanted them alive, at least initially.

He yanked the emergency release. Alarms screamed. The door locks disengaged with a pneumatic hiss that sounded like the train itself was wounded. Wind roared through the gap, bringing the smell of brake dust and morning.

"Can't jump yet," Sophia shouted over the noise. "Wait for the approach curve."

The train was already slowing, the driver responding to the alarm. But slowing from one-forty to survivable jumping speed would take distance they didn't have. The reception committee would be ready at the platform. Probably already in the forward carriages.

The businessman appeared in the doorway, real gun this time. The pretense was over.

"Step away from the door," he said in accented English. South African, Michael thought. Military contractor, not intelligence service.

"He's right," Sophia said. "Step away."

She moved faster than Michael could follow. The serving tray she'd palmed became a projectile, then a shield, then discarded as she closed the distance. The gun went off, hideously loud in the enclosed space. Someone screamed—maybe the server, maybe Michael himself.

When the motion stopped, Sophia had the gun and the businessman had a dislocated shoulder.

"Now," she said.

They jumped.

The world became a chaos of gravel and momentum. Michael hit hard, rolled badly, felt something in his chest compress and crack. Sky and track exchanged positions several times before physics finally let him stop.

He lay still, cataloguing damage. Ribs, definitely. Knee twisted but functional. The Tangier drive still in his pocket, because some part of him had protected it even while falling.

"Up." Sophia materialized beside him, jacket torn, face bloodied. "They'll have stopped the train."

She was right. The Eurostar was grinding to a halt five hundred meters down the track, emergency lights flashing. Figures were already dropping from the doors.

They ran. Or rather, they moved in the broken rhythm of people who'd forgotten they could be hurt until physics reminded them. Through a chain-link fence that Sophia opened with the businessman's gun. Across a road where morning traffic hadn't yet started. Into an industrial estate that could have been anywhere in southeastern England.

"Safe house?" Michael gasped.

"Compromised. All of them." Sophia stopped beside a delivery van, checking the doors. Locked. "Reed's flat."

"They'll be watching it."

"Not anymore." She found an older vehicle, the kind with locks that remembered simpler times. "After your extraction, it's off the grid. No operational value."

The van started on the third try. Sophia drove with the kind of careful precision that wouldn't attract attention, while Michael tried to breathe without screaming. Every pothole felt like a personal attack on his ribs.

"Hospital?" she asked.

"With what explanation?"

"Fair point."

London materialized around them in layers. Industrial giving way to residential, residential to commercial. The familiar skyline that meant home, or what used to be home before he'd learned what his government was buying from private contractors.

Reed's flat was in Pimlico, the kind of address that whispered old money and older secrets. They abandoned the van three streets away and walked like morning joggers who'd overdone it. Just another couple of fitness casualties in a city full of them.

The building had no doorman, which was why Reed had chosen it. Old habits of invisibility that had outlasted his faith in the institutions he'd served. Sophia produced a key from somewhere—Michael didn't ask how—and they climbed to the third floor in silence broken only by his labored breathing.

The flat still smelled of Tom Reed. Tea and old papers and the particular mustiness of a life lived mostly elsewhere. Someone had been through it—professionally, leaving everything exactly as found except for the microscopic signs that showed training. The angle of books on shelves, the too-perfect alignment of papers on the desk.

"Bathroom," Sophia said. "Medical supplies in the cabinet."

She was right again. Reed had maintained a field kit that would have impressed a combat medic. Michael sat on the edge of the tub while Sophia taped his ribs with brutal efficiency.

"The drive," she said. "Still intact?"

He produced it from his pocket. Such a small thing to have cost so much.

"We need to move it," she said. "Multiple copies. Dead drops."

"We need to get it to someone who can act on it."

"Who?" She finished the taping and stepped back. "Your former colleagues who marked you for extraction? My service that's contracting with the people we're exposing? The police who'll arrest us the moment we surface?"

She was right. They'd won the evidence but lost the game. Greyfriar's synthetic intelligence was already in the system, already shaping policy. Already justifying the expansion of powers that would make future investigations impossible.

"Lena," Michael said. "She has media contacts."

"Lena's probably in a cell in Brussels. Or worse."

"Then we go public ourselves."

"With what platform? They've already poisoned that well. You're the analyst who leaked classified material. I'm the unstable officer who got assets killed. Our credibility is professionally shredded."

Michael stood carefully, testing his mobility. "So we find someone whose credibility isn't."

"Reed's dead. Who else has the standing to—" She stopped. "No."

"Hargreaves has enemies. Has to have. Someone who wants his job, who'd use this against him."

"And hand them leverage over the entire system?" Sophia shook her head. "That's not exposure, that's just changing management."

"Then what?"

She didn't answer immediately. Instead, she moved to Reed's desk and began going through drawers with the kind of systematic patience that suggested she'd done this before.

"Tom was careful," she said finally. "But he was also sentimental. Kept things he shouldn't have."

"Such as?"

She pulled out a leather portfolio, the kind civil servants received after twenty-five years of service. Inside, mixed with commendation letters and retirement photos, was a single sheet of paper that didn't belong.

"Parliamentary override codes," she said. "For emergency broadcast interruption."

Michael stared at the numbers. "Those are supposed to be destroyed after use."

"Tom never destroyed anything that might be useful later." She folded the paper carefully. "Question is whether they're still valid."

"Only one way to find out."

"If they are, we get one shot. Interrupt a broadcast, dump everything we have, let the public sort it out."

"And if they're not?"

"Then we've announced our location to everyone hunting us."

Michael thought about the businessman on the train, the woman with her specialized weapon, the teenager who moved like a soldier. All the resources mobilized to stop them from reaching London with a drive full of evidence.

"They're escalating," he said. "The Canary Wharf exercise is in three days. After that, Hargreaves' emergency powers become permanent."

"Then we have three days to find a way to be believed."

She was already moving, gathering materials with the efficiency of someone planning an operation. Michael watched her work and wondered when exactly his life had become this—jumping from trains, hiding in dead men's flats, trying to prevent his own government from using fake intelligence to justify real oppression.

"There's another option," he said.

She paused. "Which is?"

"We don't try to stop it. We let it happen. But we document everything. Create a record that survives the exercise, survives the crackdown, survives long enough for someone to find it when the political wind changes."

"You want to give up?"

"I want to be realistic. We're two people with a USB drive against the entire security apparatus. Maybe the best we can do is ensure the truth exists somewhere."

Sophia turned to face him fully. "Tom Reed is dead because he believed the truth mattered. You were marked for extraction because you asked inconvenient questions. I lost my career because I trusted intelligence that was deliberately fabricated. And now you want to hide the evidence and hope someone else is brave enough to use it?"

"I want to survive long enough for the evidence to matter."

"It matters now. In three days, Canary Wharf gets locked down. Armed police, surveillance, the full security theater. Except it won't be theater. It'll be proof of concept for a new kind of state, one where private companies manufacture threats and public institutions buy them as truth."

"And you think we can stop that with one broadcast interruption?"

"I think we have to try." She held up the override codes. "Tom kept these for a reason. Maybe he saw this coming. Maybe he knew someone would need them."

Michael's ribs protested as he reached for his jacket. "Then we need more than just the Greyfriar data. We need the Dubai recording. The Brussels procurement trail. Everything that shows the pattern."

"I know someone," Sophia said. "Still inside, still clean. Might be willing to help."

"Might be?"

"Depends on whether they value their pension more than their conscience."

"Recent evidence suggests that's not a bet we should take."

"Recent evidence suggests we don't have a choice." She moved to the window, checking sightlines from habit. "We can't stay here. They'll expand the search grid once they realize we didn't head for the obvious safe houses."

"Where then?"

"Public spaces. Crowds. Keep moving until we can establish contact."

Michael thought about London's surveillance network, the cameras that turned the city into a digital panopticon. Staying invisible would be like trying to hide from God.

"The exercise," he said. "They'll need command infrastructure. Communications hubs. Data centers."

"All secured and monitored."

"But also predictable. We know where they'll be focused. Where they won't be looking."

Sophia understood immediately. "You want to use their own operation as cover."

"They're planning for external threats. Not for someone already inside their perimeter."

"Because that would be insane."

"Exactly."

She almost smiled. "Tom would have liked that. Using their paranoia against them."

They left the flat as they'd entered it, ghosts in a city that didn't believe in ghosts anymore. Everything was cameras and databases and algorithmic prediction. But algorithms were only as good as their inputs, and whoever had programmed the search parameters hadn't accounted for targets who moved toward danger instead of away from it.

The morning commute was building, London putting on its daily costume of normalcy. Michael and Sophia joined the flow, two more faces in the crowd, their injuries hidden under careful movement and practiced invisibility.

"Contact first," Sophia said as they descended into the Underground. "Then we plan the broadcast."

"And if your contact sells us out?"

"Then we'll know the system is completely compromised."

"Comforting."

"Would you prefer pretty lies or ugly truth?"

The train arrived, already packed. They squeezed in, surrounded by bankers and builders and all the ordinary people who didn't know their government was about to practice locking them down for their own protection.

As the doors closed, Michael caught a glimpse of someone on the platform. Just a figure in a coat, watching the train depart. But something about the stillness, the focus, set off every alarm Reed had trained into him.

"We were marked," he told Sophia quietly.

"I know. Question is whether they want us followed or just frightened."

"Does it matter?"

"Yes. Fear is psychological operations. Following is tactical preparation."

"For what?"

The train plunged into its tunnel, and Sophia's answer was almost lost in the noise: "For making examples of us."

They rode in silence after that, two people carrying the weight of evidence that could change everything or nothing, depending on whether anyone would listen. Above them, London went about its business, unaware that its security was being scripted by private contractors and sold back to it as necessary vigilance.

Three days until Canary Wharf.

Three days to make the truth louder than the lie.

Michael pressed his hand against his ribs, feeling the tape Sophia had applied, the drive still in his pocket, the weight of what they were attempting. Reed had died believing institutions could be saved from within. They were about to test whether he was right.

The train rushed on through darkness, carrying them toward whatever came next.
