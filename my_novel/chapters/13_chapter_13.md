Chapter 13

The M4 out of London moved like a funeral procession. Michael sat in the back of a builder's van that smelled of plaster dust and anxiety, watching the city dissolve into motorway sprawl through a crack in the rear doors. Sophia drove with the mechanical precision of someone who'd learned pursuit evasion before parallel parking. Lena occupied the passenger seat, laptop open, typing one-handed while the other gripped the door handle.

"How long before they notice we're gone?" Lena asked.

"They already know." Michael shifted position. His knee had locked from crouching. "Question is how long before they decide to do something visible about it."

"Visible being armed response units?"

"Visible being whatever Hargreaves needs for his narrative."

The van hit a pothole. Tools rattled in their cases. Somewhere behind them, London was waking up to selective truths. The morning briefings would already be circulating—sanitised versions that painted Michael as unstable, Sophia as reckless, Lena as a foreign asset. The machinery of reputation destruction working at institutional speed.

"Pull off at Reading," Michael said. "We need to split up."

"No." Sophia checked the mirror. "They want us separated. Easier to discredit."

"They'll track the van."

"They'll track everything. Question is what we do with the time before they close the net."

Lena's phone buzzed. She glanced at it, then powered it off completely. "My editor. Third message this morning."

"Saying?"

"Saying I should come in for a chat. Very polite. Very concerned about my wellbeing." She pulled the SIM card out and snapped it. "Which means they've already had their chat with someone else."

The motorway services at Reading looked like a detention facility designed by a committee that had given up halfway through. Michael watched the cameras track their arrival. Fifteen years ago, the coverage would have been patchy. Now every angle was covered, facial recognition running in real-time, feeding back to control rooms that might be in London or might be in Bangalore.

"Twenty minutes," Sophia said. "Toilet, coffee, back on the road."

"We should—"

"Look normal. Tired people driving to Bristol stop for coffee. Fugitives argue in car parks."

Inside, the services had that particular British melancholy of fluorescent lighting and overpriced sandwiches. Michael bought coffee from a machine that photographed every transaction. The security guard by the entrance wasn't trying to look casual. Neither was the man in the Barbour jacket reading yesterday's Telegraph by the window.

Lena emerged from the bathroom looking pale. "Someone's been in my flat."

"When?"

"Neighbour just texted. Said the police were there with a warrant. Terrorism Act."

"Which section?"

"Does it matter?"

It did, actually. Different sections meant different levels of oversight, different thresholds for evidence. But Michael didn't say that. The technical distinctions of their legal destruction felt academic when you were standing in motorway services watching your life disappear.

"We need to move," Sophia said. She'd bought sandwiches, bottles of water, the props of ordinary travel. "M4's too obvious. We take the A roads."

"To where?"

"Wherever we can get twelve hours to think."

The man in the Barbour jacket had stopped pretending to read. His phone was out, angled to catch their reflection in the window. Michael turned away, then thought better of it. Turning away was evidence of guilt. Everything was evidence if you needed it to be.

They took the A4 through towns that blurred together. Newbury. Hungerford. Places that had been something before they became somewhere between other places. Sophia drove like she was taking a driving test, signalling every turn, keeping precisely to speed limits. The boring competence of someone with nothing to hide.

"I've got backup of everything," Lena said. "Cloud storage they won't find."

"They'll find it." Michael had seen the technical capabilities briefings. "But it might take them a few days."

"Days we don't have."

"No. We don't."

The safe house Sophia had mentioned turned out to be a cottage outside Marlborough that belonged to no one in particular. The key was under a flowerpot that had died seasons ago. Inside, furniture covered in sheets like a crime scene waiting to be discovered.

"MI6 property?" Lena asked.

"Not exactly." Sophia checked window locks. "Belongs to someone who owes me a favour. Or owed. Past tense might be more accurate now."

Michael understood. Favours in their world came with expiration dates. Use them too late and they turned into liabilities.

The cottage had no television, no internet, no landline. A place designed for forgetting and being forgotten. Sophia found a radio in the kitchen, tuned it to Radio 4. The news came in sanitised chunks. A security alert in London. Increased police presence. The public asked to remain vigilant but not alarmed.

"They're moving fast," Lena said.

"They have to." Michael spread Reed's papers across the dining table. "The Canary Wharf exercise is in five days. Everything has to be in place before then."

"What exactly are they planning?"

Michael found the page he'd marked. "Live counter-terrorism exercise. Full lockdown of the financial district. Armed response, military assets, communications blackout. Sold as testing readiness."

"But?"

"But the threat assessment justifying it is scheduled to arrive thirty-six hours before the exercise starts. Future tense. They're going to create the intelligence that requires the response they've already planned."

Lena was typing again, this time on a laptop that looked like it had been through several previous owners. "I need to get this out. Now. Today."

"To who?" Sophia asked. "Your editor's compromised. Your paper won't touch it. The D-Notice is probably already written."

"Then we go wider. European papers. US outlets. Someone who isn't inside the UK media machinery."

"And they'll ask for verification. Sources. Documents we can't provide without exposing how we got them."

"So we're just supposed to sit here?"

"No." Michael pulled out a page covered in his own handwriting. "We're supposed to be smarter than they think we are."

The plan was simple, which meant it was probably stupid. But stupid plans sometimes worked because no one expected professionals to be that desperate.

"You want to ring Downing Street?" Lena stared at him.

"Not Downing Street. The Cabinet Secretary's office. Direct line."

"And say what?"

"That we have evidence Sir Julian Hargreaves is fabricating intelligence to justify emergency powers. That we'll go public unless they pull the Canary Wharf exercise."

"They'll trace the call."

"Yes."

"They'll know where we are."

"That's the point." Michael found the number in Reed's notes. A direct line that bypassed the switchboard, the kind of number you only got after twenty years of knowing which secrets to keep. "They think we're running. Scared. Trying to hide. But if we call them, tell them exactly where we are..."

"They'll think it's a trap," Sophia finished.

"And while they're trying to work out what kind of trap, we buy time. Maybe twelve hours. Maybe twenty-four."

"That's insane."

"No," Sophia said quietly. "That's tradecraft."

The phone was an old landline, the kind that still had a dial. Michael lifted the receiver, heard the tone that meant connection to a system that monitored everything. He dialed from memory. Two rings. Three. Then a voice he recognised.

"Cabinet Office."

"Martin? It's Michael Armitage."

Silence. Then: "Michael. You shouldn't be calling this number."

"I know. But I thought Sir Julian should know we have the Reed files. All of them. Including the ones about Greyfriar Analytics."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Then you should probably ask him. We're at the cottage in Marlborough. The one Sophia Chen knows about. We'll be here for the next six hours. After that, everything goes to the press."

"Michael—"

He hung up.

"Chen?" Sophia raised an eyebrow. "You know I'm not actually called Chen?"

"They don't know that. And they'll waste three hours trying to figure out why I got your name wrong."

Lena was staring at both of them. "You're all completely insane."

"Occupational hazard," Sophia said. She was already moving, pulling sheets off furniture, checking sightlines. "We have maybe four hours before they sort through the confusion. What do we do with them?"

Michael looked at the papers spread across the table. Four hours to find the single piece of evidence that would make the whole structure collapse. Four hours to prevent London from becoming a permanent security state. Four hours before they discovered that sometimes the stupid plan was exactly what the smart people did.

"We work," he said. "And we hope Thomas Reed was better at keeping records than he was at staying alive."

The afternoon light through the cottage windows had that particular quality of English autumn, like the sun was apologising for trying. Michael thought about Reed stepping in front of that train. About whether he'd known what was coming or simply couldn't face what he'd already seen.

Either way, they had four hours to make his death mean something.

Outside, the wind picked up, rattling windows that hadn't been opened in years. Somewhere between here and London, decisions were being made in rooms without records. The machinery of state security grinding forward, converting fear into policy, policy into profit.

Michael picked up the next file. Page one of three hundred. 

Time to work.
