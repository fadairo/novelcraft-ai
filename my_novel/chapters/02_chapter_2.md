Chapter 2

The email stared back at Michael from his monitor, each word as clinical as an autopsy report. "Following this morning's incident involving T. Reed, all departmental materials under his oversight require immediate secure filing. Report to Room 4B at 1400 hours for briefing."

Michael read it three times, waiting for the words to rearrange themselves into something that made sense. Tom Reed didn't jump in front of trains. Tom Reed wrote meticulous reports with colour-coded appendices. Tom Reed kept a photo of his daughter's graduation on his desk and complained about the canteen's coffee with religious dedication.

The basement office felt smaller than usual. Michael pushed back from his desk and walked to the water cooler, then remembered it had been empty for two weeks. Budget cuts. Even the mould seemed to be thriving on austerity.

His phone buzzed. Sarah from Human Resources, the one who always smiled too much when delivering bad news. "Michael? Just checking you received the email about the filing project. It's rather time-sensitive."

"I got it."

"Wonderful. And Michael? I'm so sorry about Tom. I know you two were close."

Were. Past tense. Death's grammar was always so precise.

"Thank you, Sarah."

"The Director wants everything sorted by end of week. Tom's files, his assessment logs, correspondence. Clean slate, he said."

"Clean slate," Michael repeated. The phrase tasted bitter.

"Oh, and Michael? Best not to discuss this with anyone outside the immediate team. You understand."

The line went dead before he could respond. Michael stared at his phone, then at the empty water cooler, then at the stain on the ceiling that looked like a map of Ireland if you squinted. Somewhere above him, in offices with windows and functioning climate control, people were already rewriting Tom Reed's legacy. Stress-related incident. Pressure of the job. Unfortunate but not unexpected given recent restructuring.

Michael knew the script. He'd helped write it once, after Cyprus.

Room 4B was on the fourth floor, tucked between the secure communications suite and a storage closet that had been converted into a "breakout space" nobody ever used. Michael arrived at 1358, because punctuality was one of the few things they couldn't take away from him. Dennis Carver was already there, standing beside a trolley stacked with banker's boxes. Each one had Reed's initials in black marker: "T.R. - CONFIDENTIAL."

"Armitage." Carver managed to make his name sound like an accusation. "Didn't expect they'd send you."

"Disappointed?"

"Practical. You knew Reed's filing system. Should make this quicker." Carver pulled on latex gloves with theatrical precision. "Everything gets reviewed, logged, and archived. Anything flagged goes straight to the Director. No copies, no photographs, no personal notes. Clear?"

"Crystal."

"Good. Start with his desk materials. I'll handle the classified cabinet."

Reed's office was exactly as Michael remembered it, except for the absence of Reed himself. The photo of his daughter still smiled from its frame. A half-empty mug of tea sat beside a stack of printouts, the liquid filmed over like a cataract. On the wall, a map of the Middle East bristled with coloured pins, each one representing what the department euphemistically called "an area of ongoing interest."

Michael began with the desk drawers. Pens, paperclips, a cache of sugar packets hoarded from the canteen. In the second drawer, beneath a manual on signal intelligence protocols, he found a folder that made him pause. "GREYFRIAR ANALYTICS - PROCUREMENT REVIEW."

The name was unfamiliar, which was unusual. After five years in assessment, Michael knew most of the contractors the JIC worked with. He opened the folder carefully, aware of Carver's presence across the room.

The first page was a standard procurement form, the kind that usually induced immediate narcolepsy. But Reed's handwritten notes in the margins were anything but standard. "Source validation?" next to one line item. "No competitive tender - why?" beside another. At the bottom, in red ink: "Direct Cabinet Office pipeline - bypasses JIC review."

Michael turned the page. A printout of an email exchange, Reed asking about Greyfriar's methodology for threat assessment. The response, from someone identified only as "J.H.", was bracingly condescending. "The partnership with Greyfriar represents a paradigm shift in intelligence gathering. Traditional validation methods are, frankly, obsolete. Trust the process, Tom."

Trust the process. Michael had trusted the process in Cyprus. Forty-three civilians had paid for that trust.

"Finding anything interesting?" Carver's voice made him jump.

"Just procurement forms. Tom loved his paperwork."

"That he did." Carver wasn't looking at him, focused instead on the classified cabinet. "Poor bastard. Job finally got to him."

Michael slipped the Greyfriar folder beneath a stack of routine assessments and continued sorting. Most of it was mundane: budget projections, staff evaluations, meeting minutes that could cure insomnia. But scattered throughout were more references to Greyfriar. Always tangential, always in Tom's careful handwriting. "G.A. threat indicators - no source attribution." "Imminent threat assessment - timeline suspicious." "Pattern recognition or pattern creation?"

By 1600, they'd filled eight boxes. Michael's back ached and his hands were grey with dust. Carver sealed each box with security tape, signing his name across the seals with bureaucratic satisfaction.

"That's the last of it," Carver announced. "Transport will collect these within the hour."

"All of it?"

"Every scrap. Like he was never here." Carver peeled off his gloves. "Probably for the best. Can't have the rank and file dwelling on... unfortunate incidents."

Michael nodded, thinking of the Greyfriar folder now buried in Box Three. "Clean slate."

"Exactly. Oh, almost forgot." Carver handed him a form. "Sign here. Confirms you've completed the filing and haven't retained any materials."

The pen felt heavy in Michael's hand. He signed, the lie flowing as smoothly as ink.

After Carver left, Michael stood alone in Reed's empty office. The map on the wall looked different now, all those coloured pins like accusations. Or warnings. He thought about the District line platform, about the precise timing of a Tuesday morning commute, about a man who'd spent thirty years learning to spot patterns suddenly becoming one himself.

His phone buzzed. Unknown number.

"Michael Armitage?"

"Speaking."

"This is Detective Inspector Martinez, British Transport Police. I understand you worked closely with Thomas Reed?"

"I did."

"I'm sorry for your loss. We're conducting routine enquiries into this morning's incident. Nothing formal, just crossing the T's. Would you be available for a brief chat tomorrow?"

Routine enquiries. Michael wondered if Martinez had ever seen a routine suicide that generated classified filing orders within six hours.

"Of course. What time?"

"Ten o'clock? We can come to your office if that's easier."

Come to his office. Into the building. Past security. Creating a record.

"Actually, I'll be working from home tomorrow. Personal day. You understand."

A pause. "Of course. Perhaps a coffee near Victoria? There's a Costa on Wilton Road."

"That works."

"Excellent. And Mr Armitage? Best not to mention our chat to your colleagues. No need to upset people further."

The line went dead. Michael looked at his phone, then at the empty office, then at the security tape across Box Three. In his pocket, his building pass felt heavier than usual, its edges suddenly sharp.

He took the stairs down to his basement office, avoiding the lift where cameras recorded every journey. At his desk, he opened a browser and typed "Greyfriar Analytics" into the search bar. No company website. No LinkedIn presence. A single news item from three months ago: "Cabinet Office Awards Strategic Intelligence Contract to Private Sector Partner." No details. No follow-up.

Michael cleared his search history and shut down his computer. As he gathered his things, he noticed something he'd missed that morning. A Post-it note stuck to the underside of his keyboard, Reed's handwriting cramped but clear: "If you're reading this, they already know. Check your six. -T"

The basement office felt very cold. Michael peeled off the note, folded it twice, and swallowed it. The paper was bitter on his tongue, but not as bitter as the realization that Tom Reed hadn't stepped in front of that train by choice.

He'd been pushed. Maybe not physically, but pushed all the same. And now they wanted Michael to clean up the evidence, sign the forms, play the grieving colleague.

Trust the process.

Michael checked his six as he left the building. Nothing obvious, but then again, the obvious ones were never the problem. As he descended into Westminster station, he found himself calculating distances, timing, the physics of a body in motion. The platform edge had been cleaned, but he imagined he could still see the stain.

The next train arrived with its familiar scream of brakes. Michael stepped back, well clear of the yellow line.

He had a feeling he'd need to be very careful about edges from now on.
