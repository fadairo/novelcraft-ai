# Chapter 4

Chapter 4

The secure filing room occupied a corner of the fourth floor that architects had apparently forgotten. No natural light, just fluorescent tubes that hummed at a frequency designed to induce headaches. Michael found Davies already there, surrounded by banker's boxes and the particular smell of papers left too long in storage.

"Armitage." Davies didn't look up from the folder he was marking. "Good. You can start with the Brussels files. Everything from January onwards."

Michael surveyed the boxes. Tom Reed's career reduced to cardboard and dust. "This is everything?"

"Everything that isn't already in deep archive." Davies finally met his eyes. The bruising under his left eye had turned from purple to yellow. "We have until close of business. Scan, tag, file. Nothing leaves this room."

"What about his personal effects?"

"Handled."

The word landed like a door closing. Michael pulled the first Brussels box toward him and lifted the lid. Procurement assessments. Joint Intelligence Committee briefings. Risk matrices for European partnerships. Tom Reed's handwriting in the margins, neat blue ink asking the questions nobody wanted answered.

They worked in silence for twenty minutes before Davies spoke again. "Did he seem different to you? These last weeks?"

Michael considered lying. "I hadn't seen much of him. Different departments."

"Since Cyprus."

Not a question. Michael kept his eyes on the file in his hands. "Yes."

"He put you forward for that assessment. The drone authorisation."

"I'm aware."

"Must have been difficult. After."

Michael turned a page, scanning for classification markers. "We all make assessments. Sometimes they're wrong."

"Seven civilians."

"I can count."

Davies returned to his box. The air conditioning cycled on, bringing the taste of recycled fear. Michael found himself reading the same paragraph three times. Something about contractor oversight in signals intelligence. A company called Greyfriar Analytics mentioned in passing, their name highlighted in yellow.

"That's the third time I've seen that name," Michael said.

Davies glanced over. "Private sector. They do modelling."

"For us?"

"For whoever pays." Davies pulled another folder. "Leave it. Above our clearance."

But Reed had highlighted it. Tom Reed, who never marked documents without reason. Michael made a mental note of the file number and moved on.

The next folder was thicker. Cabinet Office briefings from the last quarter. Reed's annotations grew more frequent toward the recent dates, his handwriting less careful. Question marks multiplied. One page had a single word written in red: "Source?"

"Find something?" Davies had noticed his pause.

"Tom was thorough."

"Too thorough, maybe."

Michael looked up sharply. Davies was watching him with the careful expression of a man choosing his words from a limited supply.

"Meaning?"

"Meaning sometimes it's better to file the assessment they want rather than the one that's accurate." Davies closed his current box with unnecessary force. "Meaning Tom forgot that distinction."

"Is that what you think happened? He forgot?"

"I think he stood too close to the platform edge." Davies's voice carried the kind of finality they taught in management seminars. "Tragic accident. Stress of the job. These things happen."

Michael felt the weight of the security camera in the corner. Every word being recorded, transcribed, filed away for future leverage. "Of course."

They returned to their boxes. Michael's hands moved on autopilot: scan, check classification, apply file tag, move to secure pile. The kind of mindless work that left too much room for thinking. He found himself studying Reed's annotations with growing unease. The questions clustered around specific dates, specific assessments. All of them seemed to touch on external contractors. All of them mentioned intelligence that had shaped policy.

Another Greyfriar reference. This time in a threat assessment for transportation infrastructure. Reed had circled their contribution and written: "Verify source data."

"I need a smoke," Davies announced. "Twenty minutes."

"Cameras."

"Twenty minutes of me smoking. Nothing irregular about that." He paused at the door. "Unless you'd rather I stay?"

The question hung between them like an unexploded ordnance. Michael kept his expression neutral. "I'll continue with the Brussels files."

Davies left. The door's magnetic lock engaged with a soft click that sounded louder in the empty room. Michael waited thirty seconds, then pulled the Greyfriar files back out.

The company appeared repeatedly in the last six months of Reed's assessments. Always in supporting roles, providing "independent verification" of threat levels. Their reports had a peculiar consistency—clean, professional, always concluding that enhanced security measures were justified. The kind of reports that made politicians feel decisive.

Michael photographed three pages with his phone before remembering where he was. The secure room would have signal shielding, but the camera would have seen him. Stupid. Sloppy. The kind of mistake that—

The door opened. Not Davies. A woman Michael didn't recognize, wearing the kind of suit that suggested seniority and the kind of expression that suggested she knew exactly what he'd just done.

"Michael Armitage?" She didn't wait for confirmation. "I'm from Internal Review. We need to discuss your current assignment."

"I'm in the middle of secure filing. Perhaps we could—"

"Now, Mr. Armitage."

She held the door open. Not a request. Michael looked at the boxes of Reed's work, then at the camera, then at the woman who was definitely not from Internal Review. Her shoes were wrong. Too expensive. Private sector.

"Of course," he said.

She led him down the corridor to an interview room he'd never seen before. Two chairs, one table, one mirror that was fooling nobody. She sat with her back to it, placing a folder on the table between them.

"You've been reviewing Thomas Reed's files."

"As instructed."

"Finding anything interesting?"

"Procurement assessments. Risk matrices. The usual."

She smiled with the kind of warmth that didn't reach above the cheekbones. "Mr. Armitage, we both know your reputation for thorough work. Cyprus notwithstanding."

There it was. The leverage, presented like an hors d'oeuvre.

"What do you want?"

"Clarity. Thomas Reed was conducting an assessment outside his remit. We believe he may have left materials that could cause unnecessary concern if misinterpreted."

"By whom?"

"By anyone without the full operational picture." She opened the folder. Michael's service photo stared back at him, paperclipped to his Cyprus assessment. The one that had killed seven civilians and his career. "You understand the importance of context."

"Context."

"Precisely. Intelligence work requires trust. Trust that our assessments will be understood properly. Trust that sensitive materials won't be... mishandled."

Michael felt the walls pressing closer. "You want me to bury something."

"Such dramatic language. We want you to ensure that Thomas Reed's legacy remains that of a dedicated public servant who tragically succumbed to the pressures of his position." She slid a single sheet across the table. "Sign this, confirming that your review found no irregularities requiring escalation, and we can all move forward."

"And if I refuse?"

She turned his service photo face-down. Beneath it was another document. A draft assessment, marked with his identifier codes, dated next week. It recommended immediate action based on flawed intelligence. The kind of assessment that would make Cyprus look like a clerical error.

"You haven't written this," Michael said.

"Not yet." She checked her watch. "But authorship is such a fluid concept in collaborative intelligence work. Isn't it?"

The fluorescent lights hummed their frequency of institutional madness. Somewhere in the building, Davies was probably finishing his cigarette, knowing exactly how long to stay away. Somewhere else, Tom Reed's body was being processed by a coroner who'd already been told what to conclude.

"I need to think."

"Of course. You have until end of business." She stood, smoothing her too-expensive skirt. "We appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Armitage. The Organisation values officers who understand the bigger picture."

She left him alone with the documents. Michael stared at the signature line, then at the draft assessment that would destroy what remained of his credibility. The camera in the corner watched him with electronic patience.

He thought about Tom Reed, standing on the platform at Westminster station. About yellow highlighter on Greyfriar Analytics. About questions in red ink that would never be answered.

Then he thought about seven civilians in Cyprus and signed the form.

Back in the filing room, Davies had returned. He glanced at Michael once, noted something in his expression, and returned to his boxes without comment. They worked through the rest of Reed's files in efficient silence. Every Greyfriar reference went into the secure filing system. Every question in red ink disappeared into bureaucratic darkness.

At five o'clock, Davies sealed the last box. "Good work today."

"Just filing."

"Right. Just filing." He paused at the door. "Michael? That coffee shop on Millbank, the one that does proper espresso? You should try it sometime. Tomorrow morning, maybe. Before work."

Another calculated statement. Another choice presented as casual suggestion. Michael nodded once.

Alone in the empty room, he looked at the boxes that contained all that remained of Thomas Reed's professional life. Sanitized, categorized, filed away. He thought about the woman who wasn't from Internal Review and the assessment he hadn't written yet.

His phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number: "Your cooperation is appreciated."

Michael deleted it and headed for the exit. In the lobby, he surrendered his security pass to the guard, who logged it with the same bored efficiency as every other evening. Outside, London's November darkness had arrived early, bringing with it the kind of rain that felt personal.

He turned up his collar and walked toward Victoria, just another civil servant heading home after a day of filing. Behind him, the lights of the fourth floor burned on. Someone else would be reading Reed's files now, the ones that actually mattered. The ones they'd never let him see.

The District line platform at Victoria was crowded with evening commuters. Michael stood well back from the edge, watching the digital display count down to the next train. Three minutes. Two. One.

When it arrived, he stepped on carefully, finding a seat where he could see both exits. The carriage smelled of wet wool and disappointment. A woman across from him was reading the Evening Standard. Small headline below the fold: "Senior Civil Servant Dies in Underground Accident."

Michael closed his eyes and let the train carry him home, trying not to think about coffee shops on Millbank or signatures on forms or the sound a train makes when it's braking too late.

Trying not to think about Tom Reed's red ink asking questions in the margins of documents that no longer existed.

The train gathered speed between stations, and Michael found himself calculating the distance from his flat to the nearest embassy. Just an intellectual exercise. Just filing away information for future reference.

Just in case.
