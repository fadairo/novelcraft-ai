Chapter 3

Michael stared at the security pass in his hand. The photo was three years old, taken before Cyprus, when he still believed in clean assessments and clear chains of command. The laminate had started to peel at the corner where his thumb worried it during meetings.

Room 4B was on the secure floor. No windows, swept twice daily, mobile phones surrendered at reception. The kind of room where careers went to die quietly.

He took the lift up from the basement, counting the floors by the way the motor changed pitch. Second floor: Policy Integration. Third: Strategic Communications. Fourth: the floor that didn't officially exist.

The corridor smelled of fresh paint trying to cover old secrets. Security cameras tracked his movement with the lazy persistence of eyes that never blinked. At the door to 4B, Michael swiped his pass and waited for the electronic lock to decide his fate.

Green light. Still trusted, then. For now.

Inside, three people waited around a conference table that had seen better decades. Sarah from HR sat with her tablet and practised smile. Next to her, a man Michael didn't recognise—grey suit, grey hair, grey demeanour. Security Services, probably. They all looked the same after a while.

The third person made Michael's step falter.

Deputy Director Patricia Thornton. Tom Reed's direct superior and the woman who'd signed off on Michael's basement reassignment after Cyprus. She looked up from a folder thick enough to stop a bullet.

"Michael. Sit."

He sat.

"I assume you understand why you're here," Thornton said.

"Tom's files need securing."

"Thomas Reed's files need more than securing." She slid a single sheet across the table. "Sign this."

Michael read it without picking it up. Official Secrets Act reminder. Enhanced provisions. The usual threats wrapped in legal language.

"I've already signed the OSA," he said.

"This is different." The grey man spoke for the first time. Voice like gravel in a blender. "This covers materials that may be beyond your current clearance level."

"Then why am I handling them?"

"Because you knew Reed's filing system," Thornton said. "And because everyone else who did is either retired, transferred, or—" She let the sentence die.

Michael signed. The pen felt heavier than it should have.

Sarah's tablet chimed. She glanced at it, then at Thornton, who nodded.

"Right then," Sarah said, her smile stretching wider. "Let's discuss the practicalities. Mr Reed's office has been sealed since this morning. You'll have supervised access from 0800 to 1700 daily. No materials leave the room. No photographs, no notes, no exceptions."

"How long do I have?"

"End of week," Thornton said. "Everything categorised, indexed, and transferred to secure storage."

Three days to process what Tom had spent twenty years accumulating. Michael wondered if that was deliberate.

"Questions?" the grey man asked.

Michael had dozens. He asked none of them.

"Good." Thornton closed the folder. "One more thing. If you find anything... irregular... you report it immediately. To me. No one else."

"Define irregular."

"You'll know it when you see it."

The meeting ended with the abruptness of a phone call no one wanted to continue. Michael found himself back in the corridor, temporary access badge in hand, wondering what exactly he'd just agreed to.

Tom's office was on the sixth floor, corner position with a view of Westminster that estate agents would kill for. The police tape across the door was purely theatrical—Tom had died three miles away on a tube platform. But theatre was important in this building.

A uniformed security officer sat on a plastic chair outside, scrolling through his phone. He looked up as Michael approached, checked the access list, and cut the tape without a word.

The office smelled of Tom. Old books, mint tea, and the particular brand of furniture polish he'd insisted on bringing from home. Everything looked normal, which somehow made it worse. The in-tray still held Thursday's distribution. A half-finished Times crossword lay on the desk, four down left blank.

Michael closed the door and stood for a moment, letting the silence settle. Tom's presence hung in the air like an unfinished conversation.

The filing cabinets lined one wall—four-drawer beasts that belonged in a museum. Tom had never trusted digital storage entirely. "Pixels can lie," he'd said once. "Paper just fades."

Michael started with the desk drawers. Personnel reviews, budget projections, the mundane archaeology of middle management. Tom's handwriting covered everything in neat annotations. He'd been a compulsive noter, adding context to documents like a scholar preparing manuscripts for posterity.

The bottom drawer was locked.

Michael tried Tom's usual combinations—daughter's birthday, wedding anniversary, the date he'd joined the service. Nothing. He sat back, thinking. Tom had been predictable in his security habits, a man who used passwords like "password123" until IT forced him to change.

On impulse, Michael tried the date of Nairobi. The lock clicked open.

Nairobi. Where Tom had made his reputation and Michael had learned that intelligence work was mostly about deciding which lies to believe. They'd never spoken about it afterwards. Some operations left scars too deep for words.

Inside the drawer: more files, but these were different. No official stamps, no distribution lists. Private collection. The kind of parallel archive that senior officers weren't supposed to keep but always did.

Michael lifted out the first folder. Procurement contracts, by the look of it. Dense legal language about "service provision" and "deliverable metrics." Nothing that should have been locked away. He was about to set it aside when a company name caught his eye.

Greyfriar Analytics Ltd.

He'd never heard of them. But Tom had circled their name in red ink, adding a single question mark in the margin.

The next folder held more contracts. Different departments, different projects, but Greyfriar's name appeared in all of them. Always as a subcontractor, never the prime. Always just below the threshold that required additional scrutiny.

Michael checked his watch. 1437 hours. He had twenty-three minutes before the security rotation.

The third folder made him stop breathing.

Cabinet Office letterhead. Classification stamps that shouldn't have been in Tom's possession. And a distribution list that included names Michael recognised from newspaper headlines rather than organisational charts.

"Independent Strategic Threat Assessment Programme" read the title page.

Below that, in Tom's careful hand: "Who watches the watchers when the watchers are watching themselves?"

Michael photographed the page with his eyes, committing it to memory. No devices allowed, Sarah had been clear about that. But they couldn't regulate what stuck in his head.

The document outlined a new initiative. Private sector analysts providing "unbiased threat assessments" directly to Cabinet Office. Bypassing the traditional intelligence apparatus to avoid "institutional blind spots" and "legacy thinking."

Greyfriar Analytics was listed as the primary contractor.

Michael turned the page. Threat assessments, dated over the last six months. Each one escalating. Chatter about potential attacks. Radicalisation indicators. Sleeper cell activation patterns. All the keywords that made politicians reach for emergency powers.

But something felt wrong about the language. Too neat. Too aligned. Like someone had written the movie version of intelligence rather than the messy reality.

The door handle turned.

Michael closed the folder, slid it back into the drawer, and was examining the desktop calendar when the security officer entered.

"Everything alright, sir?"

"Fine. Just cataloguing."

The officer glanced around the room, his eyes lingering on the open drawer. "Shift change in five minutes. You'll need to clear out."

"Of course."

Michael locked the drawer, pocketed the key, and made a show of noting file positions on his tablet. Normal activities. Nothing worth reporting.

But as he left Tom's office, one thought kept circling: Tom Reed hadn't killed himself because he was depressed or overwhelmed or any of the other reasons they'd imply in the official report.

Tom Reed had killed himself because he'd found something. And whatever it was, he'd decided that dying was better than being made to forget it.

The lift down felt longer than the journey up. Michael watched the floors count backward, each number a step further from answers he wasn't sure he wanted to find.

His phone buzzed as he reached the basement. Text from an unknown number: "Dinner? The usual place. 8pm. -S"

Michael deleted the message. He hadn't heard from Sophia Malik in two years, not since Istanbul. The fact she was reaching out now, today, felt like more than coincidence.

He sat at his desk and stared at the wall where paint was losing its battle with moisture. Somewhere in Tom's files was a thread that connected private contractors to Cabinet Office briefings. Pull it, and who knew what would unravel?

But Tom had pulled it. And Tom was dead.

Michael opened his secure terminal and began typing his preliminary report. Bland sentences about "initial cataloguing" and "standard documentation." The kind of nothing that filled a thousand reports nobody read.

He didn't mention Greyfriar Analytics.

He didn't mention the locked drawer.

He certainly didn't mention that Tom Reed's suicide was looking less like surrender and more like the opening move in a game Michael didn't yet understand.

At 1800 hours, he submitted the report, shut down his terminal, and prepared to meet a ghost from Istanbul. Outside, London settled into another grey evening, the kind where you couldn't tell if the day was ending or just giving up.

In Westminster station, they were still cleaning the tracks.
