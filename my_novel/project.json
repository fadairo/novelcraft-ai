    "synopsis": "Michael Armitage was supposed to be finished.\n\nOnce a rising analyst inside the UK’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, he wrote an assessment that helped justify a drone strike which killed civilians. Quietly demoted and publicly forgotten, he now files polite, bloodless risk summaries no one reads.\n\nThen his former mentor, Thomas Reed, steps in front of a District line train in Westminster. Within hours, the death is called a stress-related suicide. Within days, Michael is told to clear Reed’s folders and move on.\n\nInstead, he finds two things:\n\n1. Reed was about to challenge a contractor called Greyfriar Analytics, which has begun supplying \"independent imminent threat indicators\" directly into the Cabinet Office.\n2. Those indicators don’t come from human sources or intercepted chatter. They are scenario models presented as live intelligence.\n\nWhen Michael quietly raises concerns, his building pass is revoked, and an internal watchlist — meant for suspected foreign assets — suddenly has his name on it.\n\nMI6 officer Sophia Malik extracts him from his flat hours before a “counter-terror arrest team” arrives to disappear him under emergency powers that technically have not even cleared Parliament.\n\nTogether with Lena Kovács, an investigative journalist with leaked procurement audits, they follow Greyfriar’s trail from London to Brussels, Tangier, and Dubai. They discover that Greyfriar is not predicting threats; it is fabricating them. The company generates fake extremist “chatter,” injects it into official briefings, and then sells the required police/military posture as a service. Every staged crisis becomes proof that Britain needs permanent emergency measures.\n\nAt the centre is Sir Julian Hargreaves, the Cabinet Office’s “Security Transformation Envoy,” who sees democratic oversight as a luxury Britain cannot afford in an age of AI weaponisation and social fracture. His goal is to run a full “terror rehearsal” in Canary Wharf — complete with street militarisation and telecom throttling — and use it as leverage to push through sweeping security powers that will never be rolled back.\n\nAs London prepares for the so-called exercise, Michael is accused of espionage, Sophia is smeared as a reckless operator whose mistakes killed assets abroad, and Lena is framed as a foreign disinformation vector. The state, and the private machinery behind it, moves to erase them as credibility sources before they can speak.\n\nOn the day of the Canary Wharf exercise, Lena publishes everything: procurement trails, audio of Hargreaves promising “regulatory stability” to private security investors, and logs proving that the supposed terror chatter was synthetic. Michael and Sophia force their way into the Canary Wharf command floor and broadcast the drill playbook in real time — showing that the “credible imminent threat” was scripted days in advance.\n\nThe country fractures on live camera. Half the public believes they prevented an authoritarian coup. Half believes they endangered London for personal revenge.\n\nSophia is taken. Lena’s story detonates across Europe. Michael vanishes into the city with the raw source logs that can prove, in court, how the lie was built.\n\nThe bill does not quietly go through.\n\nBut neither do things go back to normal.\n",

Declared suicide within hours.\n- Michael is tasked with sanitising Reed’s files.\n- He discovers evidence that a private contractor, Greyfriar Analytics, is injecting “imminent terror threat assessments” straight into Cabinet Office briefings.\n- He quietly raises a red flag.\n- His credentials are immediately revoked. An internal \"containment\" classification marks him as a hostile leak.\n- MI6 officer Sophia Malik pulls Michael out moments before an off-books arrest team arrives at his flat.\n\n**Inciting Incident:** Michael realises he’s being framed as the leak that will justify a new internal security crackdown.\n\n**Act I End:** Michael is now officially rogue, whether he wants to be or not.\n\n---\n\n## ACT II — The Chase (Brussels → Tangier → Dubai leads)\n\n- Michael learns Sophia was burned in Istanbul after an MI6 extraction plan was allegedly “modelled for risk” by a third-party partner… which she now recognises as Greyfriar.\n- They meet Lena Kovács in Brussels, who has quietly been tracking Greyfriar contracts as an EU corruption story.\n- They uncover:\n  - Greyfriar manufactures synthetic extremist “chatter,” then routes it through offshore infrastructure to make it look like organic traffic.\n  - UK crisis teams receive that “chatter” as proof of imminent attack, then authorise heightened posture and draft emergency legislation.\n  - The legislation is pre-written. The threat is reverse engineered to justify it.\n- In Tangier, a telecom engineer provides packet logs proving the laundering of fake signals through North African and Middle Eastern relays to make them look like Islamist traffic.\n- He is killed minutes later and framed as a random street robbery.\n\n**Midpoint (Point of No Return):** They obtain audio of Sir Julian Hargreaves telling private security investors in Dubai that within days, London will “demonstrate operational readiness with full civilian compliance,” after which “regulatory stability is assured.” Translation: the state of exception will become the state.\n\n---\n\n## ACT III — Exile (Back to the UK, under attack)\n\n- Michael, Sophia, and Lena are each publicly discredited:\n  - Michael painted as an ideologically-motivated leaker in contact with “extremist foreigners.”\n  - Sophia painted as a reckless officer whose incompetence got assets killed.\n  - Lena painted as a hostile information actor laundering Russian narratives.\n- Family pressure and reputational warfare isolate Michael.\n- Sophia’s passport is quietly revoked.\n- Lena’s editor warns her: publish this and you’re persona non grata in the UK and half of Brussels.\n- Michael suggests going internal, handing evidence to MI5 and trusting oversight.\n- Sophia: “Oversight is now a product line.”\n\n**All Is Lost:** They understand they cannot clear their names privately. If they don’t go public, the story dies and the new powers become permanent.\n\n**Act III End:** They decide to blow it open in real time, during the Canary Wharf “exercise.”\n\n---\n\n## ACT IV — Return / Detonation (Canary Wharf)\n\n- Canary Wharf is locked down under the guise of a live counter-terror readiness drill.\n- Armed police, military vehicles on civilian streets, Jubilee line suspended, phone networks throttled.\n- Sir Julian prepares to announce that this was an emergency response to “credible chatter,” proof that new national security legislation must be enacted immediately.\n- Lena pushes a live investigative package: procurement trails, offshore laundering, Dubai audio.\n- Michael and Sophia breach the Wharf command floor and stream dashboards that show the exercise timeline was scripted days in advance — including the quotes ministers will give to the press.\n- The country polarises instantly. Protest erupts. Parliament is paralysed.\n- Sophia is detained as a domestic security threat.\n- Michael escapes custody with the last physical copy of Reed’s raw ingest logs — evidence that can still survive legal attack.\n- Lena publishes under her own name and refuses witness anonymity.\n\n**End State / Sequel Hook:**\n\n- The bill stalls, publicly toxic.\n- Hargreaves is forced into “medical leave,” not prison.\n- Greyfriar rebrands overnight under a new shell.\n- Michael disappears, branded traitor to some, patriot to others.\n- Sophia sits in a black site on British soil that doesn’t officially exist.\n- Lena becomes the story — and now has to survive being the story.\n",
