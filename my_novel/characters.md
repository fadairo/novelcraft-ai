# Characters

## Michael Armitage

- Age: 39
- Role: Protagonist
- Occupation: Senior Analyst (demoted), UK Joint Intelligence Organisation, Cabinet Office
- Skills: Pattern analysis, policy reading, calm crisis reasoning
- Weaknesses: Guilt-driven self-sabotage, isolationist instincts, reliance on alcohol
- Core Wound: He wrote an assessment that justified a drone strike which killed civilians
- Motivation: Make amends by proving that the system can still self-correct
- Arc: Learns the system is the problem, not the error — and chooses exposure over loyalty

## Sophia Malik

- Age: 34
- Role: Field partner / Co-protagonist
- Occupation: MI6 case officer on unofficial “gardening leave,” running an unsanctioned clean-up op
- Skills: Tradecraft, languages (French, Arabic), physical courage, improvisation
- Weaknesses: Emotionally locked; pushes people away rather than admit fear
- Core Wound: Istanbul extraction gone wrong; she was blamed for an asset’s death she didn’t cause
- Motivation: Prove she wasn’t reckless — someone sold her op
- Arc: Starts using Michael for answers; ends sacrificing her freedom to keep him (and the evidence) out

## Lena Kovács

- Age: 41
- Role: Investigative journalist / leverage broker
- Occupation: Senior correspondent for a high-profile, pan-European investigative outlet
- Skills: Procurement tracing, off-the-record sourcing, controlled release of information for maximum leverage
- Weaknesses: Deep cynicism; transactional loyalty; fear of being irrelevant in an outrage economy
- Core Wound: She’s watched major stories die because no one cared
- Motivation: Break something that actually changes policy, not just trend for a day
- Arc: Crosses from reporter to participant, putting her own name and voice on the record

## Sir Julian Hargreaves

- Age: 58
- Role: Antagonist (political face)
- Occupation: Cabinet Office “Security Transformation Envoy,” ex-acting National Security Adviser
- Public Persona: Calm, paternal, “I take no pleasure in this, but…”
- True Function: Sells the permanent emergency state to Whitehall, corporate security, and the public
- Motivation: He believes democratic process can’t move fast enough to survive modern instability
- Arc: Moves from backroom whisperer to overt manhunter, then retreats under “medical leave,” unpunished

## Greyfriar Analytics

- Role: Antagonist (systemic)
- Nature: Private “predictive threat intelligence” contractor with offshore ownership and deep UK access
- Pitch: “We detect credible threats before they manifest”
- Reality: They fabricate synthetic extremist chatter, route it through offshore infrastructure to make it look like HUMINT/SIGINT, then sell the response plan back to the state
- Motivation: Profit + leverage; they want to become indispensable infrastructure
- Arc: Exposed, then rapidly rebrands under a new holding company

## Thomas Reed

- Age: 63
- Role: Catalyst / martyr
- Occupation: Former Head of Assessment Staff, Joint Intelligence Organisation
- Skills: Bureaucratic knife work; mentoring talent quietly; knowing which truths not to write down
- Fate: Declared a suicide on the London Underground in Chapter One
- Secret: Collected ingest logs proving Greyfriar was laundering invented threats into official briefs
- Function in Story: Haunts Michael; forces him to act

## Alice Armitage

- Age: 36
- Role: Personal stakes / vulnerability
- Occupation: NHS procurement manager
- Relationship: Michael’s younger sister
- Use in Plot:
  - She grounds Michael as a human, not just a node in the machine.
  - She is leaned on by police/security services who imply Michael is aiding an extremist network.
  - Her presence shows how quickly “national security measures” turn into quiet domestic intimidation.
- Arc: From “please just come in and explain this, Mike, you’ve done nothing wrong” to “don’t contact me, they’re watching.”

## Secondary / Operational

- **SO15 Arrest Team Lead (“Huxley”):** Represents the weaponised domestic policing angle. Speaks in careful legality while doing illegal things.
- **Greyfriar Liaison (“Elliot Shaw”):** Young, hyper-competent, privately educated, believes in data over law. He’s the human face of “it’s not corruption, it’s optimisation.”
- **Cabinet Office Press Officer (Clare):** Crafts the narrative that Sophia is reckless, Lena is foreign disinfo, and Michael is radicalised. She shows how reputational warfare is now a national security tool.
