# Synopsis

Michael Armitage was supposed to be finished.

Once a rising analyst inside the UK’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, he wrote an assessment that helped justify a drone strike which killed civilians. Quietly demoted and publicly forgotten, he now files polite, bloodless risk summaries no one reads.

Then his former mentor, Thomas Reed, steps in front of a District line train in Westminster. Within hours, the death is called a stress-related suicide. Within days, Michael is told to clear Reed’s folders and move on.

Instead, he finds two things:

1. Reed was about to challenge a contractor called Greyfriar Analytics, which has begun supplying "independent imminent threat indicators" directly into the Cabinet Office.
2. Those indicators don’t come from human sources or intercepted chatter. They are scenario models presented as live intelligence.

When Michael quietly raises concerns, his building pass is revoked, and an internal watchlist — meant for suspected foreign assets — suddenly has his name on it.

MI6 officer Sophia Malik extracts him from his flat hours before a “counter-terror arrest team” arrives to disappear him under emergency powers that technically have not even cleared Parliament.

Together with Lena Kovács, an investigative journalist with leaked procurement audits, they follow Greyfriar’s trail from London to Brussels, Tangier, and Dubai. They discover that Greyfriar is not predicting threats; it is fabricating them. The company generates fake extremist “chatter,” injects it into official briefings, and then sells the required police/military posture as a service. Every staged crisis becomes proof that Britain needs permanent emergency measures.

At the centre is Sir Julian Hargreaves, the Cabinet Office’s “Security Transformation Envoy,” who sees democratic oversight as a luxury Britain cannot afford in an age of AI weaponisation and social fracture. His goal is to run a full “terror rehearsal” in Canary Wharf — complete with street militarisation and telecom throttling — and use it as leverage to push through sweeping security powers that will never be rolled back.

As London prepares for the so-called exercise, Michael is accused of espionage, Sophia is smeared as a reckless operator whose mistakes killed assets abroad, and Lena is framed as a foreign disinformation vector. The state, and the private machinery behind it, moves to erase them as credibility sources before they can speak.

On the day of the Canary Wharf exercise, Lena publishes everything: procurement trails, audio of Hargreaves promising “regulatory stability” to private security investors, and logs proving that the supposed terror chatter was synthetic. Michael and Sophia force their way into the Canary Wharf command floor and broadcast the drill playbook in real time — showing that the “credible imminent threat” was scripted days in advance.

The country fractures on live camera. Half the public believes they prevented an authoritarian coup. Half believes they endangered London for personal revenge.

Sophia is taken. Lena’s story detonates across Europe. Michael vanishes into the city with the raw source logs that can prove, in court, how the lie was built.

The bill does not quietly go through.

But neither do things go back to normal.
