SYNOPSIS
========================================================================
A shy baker enters a cut-throat baking contest and discovers resilience.

OVERVIEW
========================================================================
• 2 chapter(s) revised out of 2; 1/2 hit their word-count targets.
• Total word-count change: -50 words (from 3,100 to 3,050).
• Voice, pacing and structure are stronger overall, though a few chapters still need a final polish to smooth transitions and reinforce core themes.

CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER NOTES
========================================================================
Below are concise observations on each revised chapter:
   • Chapter  1: 1,500 → 1,400 words (-100; ON TARGET)
   • Chapter  2: 1,600 → 1,650 words (+50; OFF TARGET)

PROCESS & METHODOLOGY
========================================================================
1. Analysis – each chapter reviewed for story arc, character and style.
2. Planning – a revision plan drafted to meet word-count goals while elevating literary quality.
3. Revision – text rewritten line-by-line and cross-checked for continuity.
4. Quality Control – automated checks verified final counts and removed AI artefacts.

NEXT STEPS
========================================================================
• Read the revised material aloud to catch rhythm issues.
• Flag any plot or character points that feel inconsistent so we can address them in the next pass.
• Consider revising adjacent chapters for tonal coherence.
• Update your outline to reflect structural changes introduced here.

SUMMARY
========================================================================
Most structural and stylistic issues have now been addressed.  A targeted polish pass – particularly on chapters that drifted off target – should leave the manuscript submission-ready.
