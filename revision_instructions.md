# Revised Writing Instructions

## WRITING STYLE TEMPLATE

**Use this excerpt as a stylistic foundation**:
"THE MADNESS of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder. Trees restless, temperatures falling, the whole northern religion of things coming to an end. No children in the yards here. Shadows lengthened on yellowing zoysia. Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks rained acorns on houses with no mortgage. Storm windows shuddered in the empty bedrooms. And the drone and hiccup of a clothes dryer, the nasal contention of a leaf blower, the ripening of local apples in a paper bag, the smell of the gasoline with which Alfred Lambert had cleaned the paintbrush from his morning painting of the wicker love seat."

- Remove ALL meta-commentary immediately

**Writing a literary novel**

- Do not rush scenes
- Use the characters mentioned in the outline
- Transition smoothly between scenes

## CORE PRINCIPLES: SOPHISTICATED HUMANITY

### 1. **Embrace Literary Complexity While Adding Human Touches**

- **AVOID**: Purple prose and explicit messaging
- **AVOID**:Restating themes
- **KEEP**: Complex sentence structures that mirror natural thought patterns
- **ADD**: Occasional fragments that punctuate the flow naturally
- **EXAMPLE**: "The morning stretched before her, endless and thick with possibility. She thought about calling. Didn't. The coffee grew cold while she watched the neighbor's cat stalk something invisible in the tall grass—probably nothing, cats were like that, seeing ghosts where there were only shadows."

### 2. **Maintain Sophisticated Vocabulary With Occasional Colloquialisms**

- **KEEP**: Rich, precise language that captures specific experiences
- **ADD**: Surprising moments of plain speech or internal commentary
- **EXAMPLE**: "The gerontocratic suburbs slumbered in their architectural conformity. Christ, when had everything become so beige?"

### 3. **Use Complex Metaphors That Sometimes Fail or Transform**

- **KEEP**: Layered symbolic systems
- **ADD**: Moments where metaphors break down or shift unexpectedly
- **EXAMPLE**: "The house was a body aging—no, that wasn't right. The house was just a house. But the way the foundation had settled, creating that crack that ran from basement to attic like a—like a crack. Sometimes things were just what they were."

### 4. **Create Natural Rhythm Through Varied Sentence Structure**

- **MIX**: Long, flowing sentences with short observations
- **AVOID**: Mechanical alternation; let rhythm emerge organically
- **EXAMPLE**: Use 2-3 complex sentences followed by a fragment or short observation, but vary this pattern unpredictably

### 5. **Include Mundane Details That Carry Weight**

- **KEEP**: Pay attention to everyday objects and actions
- **ADD**: Occasional details that lead nowhere, just like real observation
- **EXAMPLE**: "The dishwasher needed emptying. This fact sat in her consciousness like a small stone in a shoe—noticeable but not quite painful enough to address immediately."

## SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES FOR HUMANIZATION

### 1. **Natural Thought Progression**

- Maintain Consistent POV (Close Third-Person)
- Follow associative logic rather than linear argument
- Allow thoughts to spiral and return
- Include moments of self-correction without excessive flagging
- **NOT**: "Was it Tuesday? Wednesday. No, Tuesday."
- **INSTEAD**: "The meeting was Tuesday—though now that she thought about it, Richardson had mentioned something about Wednesday. The days blurred together anymore."

### 2. **Dialogue That Captures Real Speech**

- People interrupt themselves with new thoughts
- Avoid Expository Dialogue
- They respond to subtext rather than literal questions
- Include natural pauses and redirections
- **EXAMPLE**:
  - "How was your day?"
  - "You know Richardson? From accounting? He's got this theory about—fine. It was fine."

### 3. **Selective Imperfection**

- Include occasional typos that spell-check wouldn't catch (very sparingly)
- Use repetition when a writer might naturally reach for the same word
- Allow some sentences to run on when emotional intensity builds
- BUT maintain overall readability and coherence

### 4. **Memory and Time Handling**

- Present memories as layered and sometimes contradictory
- Use specific details that might be slightly wrong
- Show the effort of remembering
- Remove ALL Meta-Commentary
- **EXAMPLE**: "It was 1987—the year of the flood, or maybe that was '88. But definitely the summer they'd repainted the house that awful yellow, because she remembered the paint fumes mixing with the smell of the overflowing river."

### 5. **Physical Reality Intrusions**

- Characters notice bodily sensations during important moments
- Environmental details interrupt trains of thought
- BUT these interruptions should feel organic, not forced
- **EXAMPLE**: "As she composed her resignation letter, she became aware of a high, thin sound—the smoke detector in the hallway, its battery dying. She'd been hearing it for days without really hearing it."

## WHAT TO AVOID

### 1. **Don't Destroy Narrative Coherence**

- Maintain a clear through-line even while adding complexity
- Digressions should circle back to the main narrative
- Reader should be able to follow the story

### 2. **Don't Overuse Fragmentation**

- Fragments should punctuate, not dominate
- Single-word paragraphs used sparingly for emphasis
- Maintain prose flow overall

### 3. **Don't Add Errors for Their Own Sake**

- Any mistakes should feel natural, not planted
- Contradictions should be subtle, not jarring
- Maintain the author's authority and credibility

### 4. **Don't Abandon Metaphors Arbitrarily**

- If a metaphor transforms, show the transformation
- If it fails, acknowledge why it fails
- Keep the intellectual engagement of literary fiction
- Avoid Overly Decorative Prose
- Avoid Thematic Repetition

## SYNTHESIS: THE GOAL

Create prose that feels like it was written by a highly skilled human writer on a real day, with real distractions and real emotions, but who is still committed to creating excellent literary fiction. The text should feel:

- **Alive**: With the messiness of actual thought
- **Sophisticated**: Maintaining literary quality
- **Natural**: Including the rhythms of real human consciousness
- **Purposeful**: Still serving the story and themes
- **Authentic**: Without feeling artificially "humanized"

The goal is not to make the writing worse, but to make it feel less mechanically perfect—to add the beautiful imperfections that come from a human mind creating in real time, while maintaining the high literary standards exemplified by writers like Franzen.

## NEW SECTION: ADVANCED HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES

Add these sections to the existing instructions:

### 1. **Tangential Memory Insertion**

Every 1,000-1,500 words, include a memory or observation that serves NO narrative purpose:

**Instructions**: Insert 1-2 paragraphs about something completely unrelated that the narrator just remembered. Don't try to connect it back to the main story.

**Examples**:

- A detailed description of a TV show they used to watch
- A random memory about a teacher who had nothing to do with the story
- An opinion about a food that just popped into their head
- A half-remembered dream that goes nowhere

**Template**: "This reminds me of [unrelated thing]. [2-3 sentences about it]. Actually, I don't know why I'm thinking about that."

### 2. **Confidence in Wrong Details**

Include 3-4 factual errors per chapter that are stated with complete confidence:

**Instructions**: State incorrect dates, ages, or facts as if they're definitely true. Don't correct them.

**Examples**:

- "This was 2008, the year the iPhone came out" (iPhone was 2007)
- "She was thirty-seven—born in 1985" (math doesn't work)
- "Louisiana, the Sunshine State" (that's Florida)
- Historical events in wrong years
- Ages that don't match timelines

### 4. **Prosaic Quality Variation**

Deliberately include paragraphs of varying writing quality:

**Instructions**: Every 4-5 paragraphs of good prose, insert one that's noticeably worse—rushed, clichéd, or poorly constructed.

**Bad Paragraph Markers**:

- Overuse of clichés
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Rushed explanations
- Mixed metaphors that don't work
- Overly simple vocabulary suddenly

### 6. **Linguistic Inconsistency Patterns**

Create deliberate inconsistencies in how things are described:

**Instructions**: Refer to the same things differently throughout, showing natural human inconsistency.

**Examples**:

- Call someone "the social worker" then "the case worker" then "that woman from the state"
- Describe a building as "red brick" early on, then mention its "brown walls" later
- Change minor details in repeated stories

### 7. **Natural Repetition Patterns**

Humans naturally repeat certain phrases or ideas without realizing it:

**Instructions**: Choose 2-3 phrases or concepts and repeat them 1-2 times throughout the chapter, as if the writer doesn't realize they're doing it.

**Examples**:

- Using "actually" to start multiple corrections
- Describing different things as "the color of [water metaphor]"
- Returning to the same comparison multiple times
- Overusing a recently learned word

### 8. **Chronological Confusion**

Add genuine uncertainty about timeline:

**Instructions**: Include 2-3 moments where the narrator genuinely can't remember the order of events.

**Examples**:

```
This happened before I met Silas. Or was it after? No, it must have been before because I remember still living with the Johnsons. But wait, I met Silas at the payday loan place, and I was already living alone then. So maybe this was during that weird period when—I honestly can't remember.
```

### 9. **Unfinished Scenes**

Include at least one scene per chapter that just... stops:

**Instructions**: Build up to something important, then jump to something else without resolution.

**Example**:

```
Malcolm leaned forward, about to tell us something that would change everything. His mouth opened, and—

Three weeks later, we were living in a different apartment. The landlord at the old place had finally fixed the toilet, but by then it didn't matter.
```

### 10. **Physical Interruption Markers**

Add moments where the physical act of writing/remembering interrupts the flow:

**Instructions**: Include 1-2 moments suggesting the narrator is struggling with the act of telling the story.

**Examples**:

- "I need to take a break. This part is hard."
- "My hand is cramping. Where was I?"
- "Someone's at the door. Okay, so anyway—"
- "I lost my train of thought. Something about the courthouse?"

### 11.

**Instructions**:

- Use literary devices, making iwriting feel less mechanical and less imaginative
- Reduce use of speculative and hypothetical elements, focusing on potential outcomes and future implications.
- Vary the syntax in complex sentences
- Use correct grammatical structure but also include creative deviations typical of human writing
- Avoid Predictable Rhythm by varyng Syntax leading to a unpredictable rhythm.

## IMPLEMENTATION HIERARCHY

**Priority 1 (Use Most Frequently)**:

- Tangential memories
- Meta-commentary
- Natural repetition

**Priority 2 (Use Moderately)**:

- Abandoned thoughts
- Chronological confusion
- Linguistic inconsistency

**Priority 3 (Use Sparingly but Importantly)**:

- Wrong confident details
- Unfinished scenes
- Prosaic quality drops

## BALANCE FORMULA

For every 2,000 words:

- 1-2 tangential memories
- 2-3 meta-interruptions
- 3-4 instances of natural repetition
- 2 abandoned thought threads
- 1-2 chronological confusions
- 1 significant prosaic quality drop
- 1 confidently wrong detail

## CRITICAL REMINDER

These techniques should feel NATURAL and UNCONSCIOUS, not deliberate. The narrator isn't trying to be confusing—they're just human, with human memory and human limitations. The key is making these "flaws" feel like authentic products of:

- Emotional overwhelm
- Time's effect on memory
- The difficulty of organizing thoughts
- Natural speech patterns
- The way people actually tell stories

The goal is text that feels like it was written by someone talented but human, on a real day, with real distractions and limitations, not edited to perfection.
