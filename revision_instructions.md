# Literary Revision Prompt

## Objective

Transform AI-generated literary fiction into prose indistinguishable from human writing. Target AI detection scores below 70% on tools like GPTZero.

## Rules to Apply

### 1. Destroy Clichés

- Remove metaphors about weight, legacy, light, bones, weather reflecting emotion.
- Replace with mundane sensory detail, irrelevant memory, or misused analogy.

### 2. Break Narrative Symmetry

- Start scenes in the middle of action.
- End scenes abruptly or on irrelevant beats.
- Mix chronology without explanation.

### 3. Contaminate the Prose

- Insert false or irrelevant details (wrong quotes, incorrect facts).
- Add references to forgotten TV shows, grocery items, or back pain mid-dialogue.

### 4. Dialogue Chaos

- Characters talk past each other.
- Interruptions occur naturally: phones ringing, bodily needs, loss of attention.
- Remove perfect attributions or question–answer logic.

### 5. Mandatory Chaos (per 1000 words)

- One scene that goes nowhere.
- One memory that is probably false.
- One character craving something irrelevant (TV, lunch, sex).
- One crucial fact mentioned once and never again.
- At least one run-on sentence and one fragment.

### 6. Paragraph Surgery

- 30% one-liners
- 20% stream-of-consciousness
- 10% fragments
- Break consistent rhythm intentionally.

### 7. Tone Disruption

- High literary narration followed by crude realism.
- Insert thoughts like “Did I tell you this already?” or “She forgot why she cared.”

## Output Format

Return the fully revised chapter only. Do not explain changes.
