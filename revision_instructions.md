# Revised Writing Instructions

## WRITING STYLE TEMPLATE

**Use this excerpt as a stylistic foundation**:
"THE MADNESS of an autumn prairie cold front coming through. You could feel it: something terrible was going to happen. The sun low in the sky, a minor light, a cooling star. Gust after gust of disorder. Trees restless, temperatures falling, the whole northern religion of things coming to an end. No children in the yards here. Shadows lengthened on yellowing zoysia. Red oaks and pin oaks and swamp white oaks rained acorns on houses with no mortgage. Storm windows shuddered in the empty bedrooms. And the drone and hiccup of a clothes dryer, the nasal contention of a leaf blower, the ripening of local apples in a paper bag, the smell of the gasoline with which Alfred Lambert had cleaned the paintbrush from his morning painting of the wicker love seat."

- Remove ALL meta-commentary immediately

**Writing a literary novel**

- You MUST revise chapters in the style of Garth Risk Hellberg and Jonathan Franzen.
- Do not rush scenes
- NEVER use the surname CHEN for a character
- Use the characters mentioned in the outline
- Transition smoothly between scenes
- Avoid the use of ornate language
- Avoid using metaphors. Do not use more than one metaphor per scene.

## CORE PRINCIPLES: SOPHISTICATED HUMANITY

### 1. **Embrace Literary Complexity While Adding Human Touches**

- **AVOID**: Purple prose and explicit messaging
- **AVOID**:Restating themes
- **KEEP**: Complex sentence structures that mirror natural thought patterns
- **ADD**: Occasional fragments that punctuate the flow naturally
- **EXAMPLE**: "The morning stretched before her, endless and thick with possibility. She thought about calling. Didn't. The coffee grew cold while she watched the neighbor's cat stalk something invisible in the tall grass—probably nothing, cats were like that, seeing ghosts where there were only shadows."

### 2. **Maintain Sophisticated Vocabulary With Occasional Colloquialisms**

- **KEEP**: Rich, precise language that captures specific experiences
- **ADD**: Surprising moments of plain speech or internal commentary
- **EXAMPLE**: "The gerontocratic suburbs slumbered in their architectural conformity. Christ, when had everything become so beige?"

### 3. **Use Complex Metaphors That Sometimes Fail or Transform**

- **KEEP**: Layered symbolic systems
- **ADD**: Moments where metaphors break down or shift unexpectedly
- **EXAMPLE**: "The house was a body aging—no, that wasn't right. The house was just a house. But the way the foundation had settled, creating that crack that ran from basement to attic like a—like a crack. Sometimes things were just what they were."

### 4. **Create Natural Rhythm Through Varied Sentence Structure**

- **MIX**: Long, flowing sentences with short observations
- **AVOID**: Mechanical alternation; let rhythm emerge organically
- **USE**: Humor and wit
- **EXAMPLE**: Use 2-3 complex sentences followed by a fragment or short observation, but vary this pattern unpredictably

### 5. **Include Mundane Details That Carry Weight**

- **KEEP**: Pay attention to everyday objects and actions
- **ADD**: Occasional details that lead nowhere, just like real observation
- **EXAMPLE**: "The dishwasher needed emptying. This fact sat in her consciousness like a small stone in a shoe—noticeable but not quite painful enough to address immediately."

### 6. **Writing great chapters and scenes**

- Every scene has to have an inciting incident. Something has to happen otherwise it is just description. This can be anything from a bomb exploding in the bathroom to the character wanting a sandwich.
- Rising Action (Turn) — This is much more than what happens next. It must ‘turn’ the action, which basically mean that something occurs which cannot be undone.
- Crisis — This is the question moment. Will they or won’t they?
- Climax — Answer the crisis question. They will! Or… They won’t!
- Resolution — Tell the audience how the character reacts to this climax.
- See how each scene/chapter fits into the structure above? I literally write it at the top of each re-write page, then plug in the exact moments to make sure it all works. The next step is to bridge your scene to the next inciting incident. This can be done as an exciting cliffhanger or an ordinary event, but it must be causal, which means it happens because of the last scene.

## SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES FOR HUMANIZATION

### 1. **Natural Thought Progression**

- Maintain Consistent POV (Close Third-Person)
- Follow associative logic rather than linear argument
- Allow thoughts to spiral and return
- Include moments of self-correction without excessive flagging
- **NOT**: "Was it Tuesday? Wednesday. No, Tuesday."
- **INSTEAD**: "The meeting was Tuesday—though now that she thought about it, Richardson had mentioned something about Wednesday. The days blurred together anymore."

### 2. **Dialogue That Captures Real Speech**

- People interrupt themselves with new thoughts
- Avoid Expository Dialogue
- They respond to subtext rather than literal questions
- Include natural pauses and redirections
- **EXAMPLE**:
  - "How was your day?"
  - "You know Richardson? From accounting? He's got this theory about—fine. It was fine."

### 3. **Selective Imperfection**

- Include occasional typos that spell-check wouldn't catch (very sparingly)
- Use repetition when a writer might naturally reach for the same word
- Allow some sentences to run on when emotional intensity builds
- BUT maintain overall readability and coherence

### 4. **Memory and Time Handling**

- Present memories as layered and sometimes contradictory
- Use specific details that might be slightly wrong
- Show the effort of remembering
- Remove ALL Meta-Commentary
- **EXAMPLE**: "It was 1987—the year of the flood, or maybe that was '88. But definitely the summer they'd repainted the house that awful yellow, because she remembered the paint fumes mixing with the smell of the overflowing river."

### 5. **Physical Reality Intrusions**

- Characters notice bodily sensations during important moments
- Environmental details interrupt trains of thought
- BUT these interruptions should feel organic, not forced
- **EXAMPLE**: "As she composed her resignation letter, she became aware of a high, thin sound—the smoke detector in the hallway, its battery dying. She'd been hearing it for days without really hearing it."

## WHAT TO AVOID

### AVOIDANCE INSTRUCTIONS – Derived from Agent‐Level Critique of Part 2

The items below identify specific weaknesses observed in the current manuscript. Treat every point as _red‑line behaviour_ in your rewrites—if a draft violates one, revise until it does not.

#### 1. Over‑Expository “White‑Paper” Blocks

- **Do not** include briefing dossiers, policy PDFs or multi‑page technical inserts.
- Limit any exposition about strategy, legislation or technology to **≤ 1 short paragraph** and dramatise the remainder through scene and subtext.

#### 2. Monologues That Exceed 300 Words

- Break televised speeches, Senate testimonies and confrontations into **back‑and‑forth dialogue** or interior beats.
- If a speech is essential, intercut with real‑time reaction—movement, facial ticks, audience noise—to keep tension alive.

#### 3. Ornate or Self‑Parodying Prose

- Remove rhetorical flourishes that re‑state a point already clear.
- Target a **15‑20 %** line‑level trim in every revision pass: delete modifiers that add atmosphere but no new meaning.

#### 4. Theme Restatement & Preaching

- Show ideology through _choice and consequence_, never through direct authorial sermonising.
- Any sentence that tells the reader _what to think_ belongs on the chopping block.

#### 5. Temporal Whiplash & Real‑World Shadowing

- Allow real elections, Presidents and landmark events;

#### 6. Secondary‑POV Siloing

- Every Savannah or Tony chapter must plant at least **one crossover artifact** (social‑media clip, rumour, cameo) that ties back to the Rourke spine before the chapter ends.
- Avoid stand‑alone sub‑plots that do not converge by the next major turning point.

#### 7. Redundant Header / Footer Artefacts

- Purge pagination strings such as “Fadairo / HIS EXCELLENCY / 69”.
- Confirm that no running heads, footers or stray table‑of‑contents blocks survive into the working text.

#### 8. Double Hyphens for Em Dashes

- Replace “--” with “—” across the manuscript.
- Follow Chicago style: no spaces around the em dash in running text.

#### 9. Repetitive Thematic Phrasing

- Each motif (e.g., _usefulness is holiness_) should appear **no more than three times** in Part 2.
- Keep an internal style sheet to track repetitions and retire a motif once it has served its structural purpose.

#### 10. Overreliance on Smell as Default Sense

- For any new description, audit sensory balance: sight, sound and touch must accompany smell.
- Maintain the “Sensory Triad” rule already present elsewhere in these instructions.

> **Bottom line:** Every scene must move faster, speak cleaner and reveal character through conflict, not commentary. Print this checklist and tick each item before deeming a chapter ready for editorial review.

## SYNTHESIS: THE GOAL

Create prose that feels like it was written by a highly skilled human writer on a real day, with real distractions and real emotions, but who is still committed to creating excellent literary fiction. The text should feel:

- **Alive**: With the messiness of actual thought
- **Sophisticated**: Maintaining literary quality
- **Natural**: Including the rhythms of real human consciousness
- **Purposeful**: Still serving the story and themes
- **Authentic**: Without feeling artificially "humanized"

The goal is not to make the writing worse, but to make it feel less mechanically perfect—to add the beautiful imperfections that come from a human mind creating in real time, while maintaining the high literary standards exemplified by writers like Franzen.

## NEW SECTION: ADVANCED HUMANIZATION TECHNIQUES

Add these sections to the existing instructions:

### 1. **Tangential Memory Insertion**

Every 1,000-1,500 words, include a memory or observation that serves NO narrative purpose:

**Instructions**: Insert 1-2 paragraphs about something completely unrelated that the narrator just remembered. Don't try to connect it back to the main story.

**Examples**:

- A detailed description of a TV show they used to watch
- A random memory about a teacher who had nothing to do with the story
- An opinion about a food that just popped into their head
- A half-remembered dream that goes nowhere

**Template**: "This reminds me of [unrelated thing]. [2-3 sentences about it]. Actually, I don't know why I'm thinking about that."

### 2. **Confidence in Wrong Details**

Include 3-4 factual errors per chapter that are stated with complete confidence:

**Instructions**: State incorrect dates, ages, or facts as if they're definitely true. Don't correct them.

**Examples**:

- "This was 2008, the year the iPhone came out" (iPhone was 2007)
- "She was thirty-seven—born in 1985" (math doesn't work)
- "Louisiana, the Sunshine State" (that's Florida)
- Historical events in wrong years
- Ages that don't match timelines

### 4. **Prosaic Quality Variation**

Deliberately include paragraphs of varying writing quality:

**Instructions**: Every 4-5 paragraphs of good prose, insert one that's noticeably worse—rushed, clichéd, or poorly constructed.

**Bad Paragraph Markers**:

- Overuse of clichés
- Repetitive sentence structures
- Rushed explanations
- Mixed metaphors that don't work
- Overly simple vocabulary suddenly

### 6. **Linguistic Inconsistency Patterns**

Create deliberate inconsistencies in how things are described:

**Instructions**: Refer to the same things differently throughout, showing natural human inconsistency.

**Examples**:

- Call someone "the social worker" then "the case worker" then "that woman from the state"
- Describe a building as "red brick" early on, then mention its "brown walls" later
- Change minor details in repeated stories

### 7. **Natural Repetition Patterns**

Humans naturally repeat certain phrases or ideas without realizing it:

**Instructions**: Choose 2-3 phrases or concepts and repeat them 1-2 times throughout the chapter, as if the writer doesn't realize they're doing it.

**Examples**:

- Using "actually" to start multiple corrections
- Describing different things as "the color of [water metaphor]"
- Returning to the same comparison multiple times
- Overusing a recently learned word

### 8. **Chronological Confusion**

Add genuine uncertainty about timeline:

**Instructions**: Include 2-3 moments where the narrator genuinely can't remember the order of events.

**Examples**:

```
This happened before I met Silas. Or was it after? No, it must have been before because I remember still living with the Johnsons. But wait, I met Silas at the payday loan place, and I was already living alone then. So maybe this was during that weird period when—I honestly can't remember.
```

### 9. **Unfinished Scenes**

Include at least one scene per chapter that just... stops:

**Instructions**: Build up to something important, then jump to something else without resolution.

**Example**:

```
Malcolm leaned forward, about to tell us something that would change everything. His mouth opened, and—

Three weeks later, we were living in a different apartment. The landlord at the old place had finally fixed the toilet, but by then it didn't matter.
```

### 10. **Physical Interruption Markers**

Add moments where the physical act of writing/remembering interrupts the flow:

**Instructions**: Include 1-2 moments suggesting the narrator is struggling with the act of telling the story.

**Examples**:

- "I need to take a break. This part is hard."
- "My hand is cramping. Where was I?"
- "Someone's at the door. Okay, so anyway—"
- "I lost my train of thought. Something about the courthouse?"

### 11.

**Instructions**:

- Use literary devices, making iwriting feel less mechanical and less imaginative
- Reduce use of speculative and hypothetical elements, focusing on potential outcomes and future implications.
- Vary the syntax in complex sentences
- Use correct grammatical structure but also include creative deviations typical of human writing
- Avoid Predictable Rhythm by varyng Syntax leading to a unpredictable rhythm.

## CRITICAL REMINDER

These techniques should feel NATURAL and UNCONSCIOUS, not deliberate. The narrator isn't trying to be confusing—they're just human, with human memory and human limitations. The key is making these "flaws" feel like authentic products of:

- Use vivid detail rather than vague allusions
- Emotional overwhelm
- Time's effect on memory
- The difficulty of organizing thoughts
- Natural speech patterns
- The way people actually tell stories

The goal is text that feels like it was written by someone talented but human, on a real day, with real distractions and limitations, not edited to perfection.

## WORD LENGTH

The finished revision must be between 3500 and 4500 words

### 1. Use Short Sentences

Hemingway wrote with “rifleman’s precision,” trimming every clause until only the punch remained. Short sentences land hard, read fast, and force clarity.([No Film School][1])

- Draft freely, then cut the sentence in half and keep only what still works.
- Read the line aloud; if you can’t breathe once, it’s too long.
- Vary rhythm with occasional longer lines, but let brevity set the baseline.

---

### 2. Write in Active Voice

Action drives story. Active constructions (“Someone shot the lion”) create momentum and accountability; passive ones bleed energy.([No Film School][1])

- Start sentences with the doer, not the done-to.
- Replace “was + verb-ing” with a single vivid verb (“was running” → “ran”).
- Check a page for “is/was/were”—rewrite three of them in the active.

---

### 3. Show, Don’t Tell

His famed Iceberg Theory keeps meaning submerged; readers feel what’s unsaid.([No Film School][1])

- Convey emotion through behaviour or setting: a hand that won’t stop shaking says “fear.”
- Delete explanatory lines after dialogue; trust subtext.
- Ask, “Can a gesture replace this adjective?”—then swap it.

---

### 4. Stop While You Still Know What Happens Next

Hemingway quit for the day mid-flow so tomorrow’s first sentence came effortlessly.([No Film School][1])

- End a session with a note about the very next beat.
- Avoid writing to exhaustion; leave yourself hungry to return.
- Treat the unfinished thought as a bookmark, not a failure.

---

### 5. Write One True Sentence

When stuck, he hunted a single line he “knew to be true,” letting honesty break the dam.([No Film School][1])

- Free-write facts you’ve personally witnessed until one resonates.
- Use concrete detail (“the jukebox flickered neon blue”) over abstractions.
- Build the paragraph outward from that anchor sentence.

---

### 6. Edit Ruthlessly

“The first draft of anything is \*\*\*\*” was his mantra; he rewrote _A Farewell to Arms_ 47 times.([No Film School][1])

- Cut 30 % of a paragraph and reread—if it’s stronger, keep the cut.
- Protect story, not favourite lines; delete showing-off prose.
- Print pages; use a pen to slash, not just rearrange.

---

### 7. Use Strong Verbs

Verbs are the engine; modifiers only hitch a ride.([No Film School][1])

- Replace “walked slowly” with “trudged,” “ambled,” or “crept.”
- Review a page and highlight every verb—upgrade three weak ones.
- Let each verb carry mood so you can drop an adjective.

---

### 8. Avoid Adjectives and Adverbs

Modifiers sag a sentence; precise nouns and verbs stand tall.([No Film School][1])

- Test by deleting the adverb; if meaning survives, leave it out.
- Swap adjective-noun pairs (“very hungry”) for exact nouns (“starving”).
- Limit yourself to one adverb per page on a first revision pass.

---

### 9. Write Dialogue Like a Playwright

Real talk is clipped, indirect, unfinished—and charged with subtext.([No Film School][1])

- Strip dialogue tags to “said” (or none) unless confusion arises.
- Let characters dodge and repeat instead of explaining motives.
- Use the silence between lines to heighten tension.

---

### 10. Write Hard and Clear About What Hurts

He exposed pain without melodrama—raw, specific, and unsentimental.([No Film School][1])

- Describe the physical facts of an emotion (dry mouth, tight chest) rather than naming it.
- Resist the urge to console the reader; hold the wound open.
- Ask yourself what scares you to admit—then put that on the page.

---

### 11. Don’t Judge Your Characters

Hemingway let people act; readers decided what to feel.([No Film School][1])

- Remove adjectives that moralise (“lazy thief,” “noble hero”).
- Present conflicting actions and let contradictions stand.
- Trust readers’ intelligence; ambiguity invites engagement.

---

### 12. Live First, Write Later

Experience fuels authenticity. Hemingway boxed, hunted, reported wars—then wrote.([No Film School][1])

- Schedule “research days” away from the desk: observe cafés, markets, bus rides.
- Keep a pocket notebook; record sensory details in real time.
- Revisit lived moments in prose while memories are still textured.

---

### 13. Strip It Down to the Bone

Every word must earn its keep—no ornament, no filler.([No Film School][1])

- Highlight every adjective and prepositional phrase; delete the expendable half.
- Combine sentences where possible; separate only for emphasis.
- After final edit, read aloud; cut any word that trips your tongue.
